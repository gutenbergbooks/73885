  <h2 class="sp3 ac" title="PREFACE" style="margin-bottom:3.6ex;"><span
  class="x-larger">PREFACE</span></h2>

  <p>Linnaeus had but a poor opinion of the Amphibia and their describers, or he would not have
  called the former "pessima tetraque animalia," nor would he have dismissed the latter with the
  terse remark: "Amphibiologi omnium paucissimi sunt nullique veri." That was, however, nearly 150
  years ago; and at the present time there are fewer difficulties in writing a book on Amphibia and
  Reptiles. Those who care for the study of Amphibia and Reptiles&ndash;the Herpetologists, to give
  them their scientific title&ndash;have never been numerous; but most of them have been serious
  students. One reason for the fact that this branch of Natural History is not very popular, is a
  prejudice against creatures some of which are clammy and cold to the touch, and some of which may
  be poisonous.  People who delight in keeping Newts or Frogs, Tortoises or Snakes, are, as a rule,
  considered eccentric. But in reality these cold-blooded creatures are of fascinating interest
  provided they are studied properly. The structure of animals is intimately connected with their
  life-habits; and this correlation is perhaps more apparent in Amphibia and Reptiles than in any
  other class. The anatomist who studies internal and external structure is as much struck with the
  almost endless variety in details as he who takes the trouble to observe the living animal in its
  native haunts, or at least under conditions not too unnatural. He will agree with V. von
  Scheffel's Toad "that those above seem to have no <span class="pagenum" id="pagevi"><span
  class="smaller">{vi}</span></span>notion of the beauties of the swamp"&ndash;brilliantly coloured
  Newts engaged in amorous play, concert-giving Frogs, and metamorphosing Tadpoles. The motto
  assigned to the Reptiles seems singularly appropriate when we consider that poisonous snakes have
  been developed from harmless forms, and that many kinds of reptiles have lost limbs, teeth, and
  eyesight in the process of evolution.</p>

  <p>The present work is intended to appeal to two kinds of readers&ndash;to the field-naturalist,
  who, while interested in life-histories, habits, and geographical distribution, beauty or
  strangeness of forms, is indifferent to the homologies of the metasternum or similar
  questions;&ndash;and to the morphologist, who in his turn is liable to forget that his specimens
  were once alive.</p>

  <p>A great portion of the book is anatomical and systematic. It was necessary to treat anatomy,
  especially that of the skeleton, somewhat fully, since it has long been recognised that it is
  impossible to base a scientific classification upon external characters. The reader familiar with
  Vertebrate anatomy has a right to expect that questions of special morphological interest will be
  dwelt upon at length. Those who have no anatomical foundation must be referred to one of the now
  numerous introductory manuals on the subject.</p>

  <p>The account of the Amphibia is more complete than that of the Reptilia. It was possible to
  diagnose practically all the recent genera; and this has been especially done in the Anura, in
  order to show how in an otherwise very homogeneous group almost any part of the body, internal or
  external, can be modified in kaleidoscopic variety. The same could not be done with the Reptilia.
  Their principal groups,&ndash;called sub-classes in the present work, in order to emphasise their
  taxonomic importance in comparison with the main groups of Birds and Mammals,&ndash;differ so much
  from each other that it was decided to refrain <span class="pagenum" id="pagevii"><span
  class="smaller">{vii}</span></span>from attempting a general account of them. Moreover, the number
  of species of recent lizards and snakes is so bewildering, the genera of many families being but
  tedious variations of the same theme, that only those forms have been described which are the most
  important, the most striking, or which the traveller is most likely to come across. The student
  who wishes to go farther into systematic details must consult the seven volumes of the
  <i>Catalogue of Reptiles in the British Museum</i> (London, 1889-1896). Mr. G. A. Boulenger, the
  author of this magnificent series, has rendered the systematic treatment of recent Amphibia and
  Reptiles an easy task. During many years of the most friendly intercourse I have profited on
  countless occasions by his ever-ready advice. Although he has kindly read the proofs of the part
  dealing with the Amphibia it would be unfair to associate him with any of its shortcomings or with
  contestable opinions, for which I alone am responsible.</p>

  <p>Cope's large work on the Crocodilians, Lizards, and Snakes of North America (<i>Rep. U.S. Nat.
  Mus. for 1898</i> (1900)) has unfortunately appeared too late to be used in the present work.</p>

  <p>The drawings on wood were, with few exceptions, made by Miss M. E. Durham, mostly from living
  specimens&ndash;a procedure which has to a great extent determined the selection of the
  illustrations.</p>

  <p>Since both the metric and the English systems of measurements have been employed, it may be
  well to state for the convenience of the reader that the length of a line of the text is four
  inches or approximately ten centimeters.</p>

  <p>I have frequently and freely quoted accounts of previous authors instead of paraphrasing them.
  Especial thanks are due to Messrs. Longmans, Green, and Co., and to Messrs. Murray, <span
  class="pagenum" id="pageviii"><span class="smaller">{viii}</span></span>for their courteous
  permission to make several long quotations from Sir J. E. Tennent's <i>Ceylon</i>, and from H. W.
  Bates' <i>Naturalist on the River Amazons</i>.</p>

  <p>Lastly, a remark about my Editors. Instead of being a source of annoyance they have rendered me
  the greatest help.</p>

  DEFINITION&ndash;POSITION OF THE CLASS AMPHIBIA IN THE PHYLUM VERTEBRATA&ndash;HISTORICAL ACCOUNT
  OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF AMPHIBIA</span></p>

  <p>A bird is known by its feathers, a Beast by its hairs, a Fish by its fins, but there is no such
  obvious feature which characterises the Amphibia and the Reptiles. In fact, they are neither fish,
  flesh, nor fowl. This ill-defined position is indicated by the want of vernacular names for these
  two classes, a deficiency which applies not only to the English language. All the creatures in
  question are backboned, creeping animals. Those which are covered with horny scales, and which
  from their birth breathe by lungs only, as Crocodiles, Tortoises, Lizards, and Snakes, are the
  Reptiles. The rest, for instance, Newts or Efts, Frogs and Toads, are the Amphibia. Their skin is
  mostly smooth and clammy and devoid of scales; the young are different from the adult in so far as
  they breathe by gills and live in the water, before they are transformed into entirely
  lung-breathing, terrestrial creatures. But there are many exceptions. <i>Proteus</i> and
  <i>Siren</i> the mud-eel, always retain their gills; while not a few frogs undergo their
  metamorphosis within the egg, and never breathe by gills. If we add the tropical limbless,
  burrowing Coecilians, and last, not least, the Labyrinthodonts and other fossil forms, the proper
  definition of the class Amphibia,&ndash;in other words, the reasons for grouping them together
  into one class, separated from the other backboned animals,&ndash;requires the examination of many
  other characters.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page4"><span class="smaller">{4}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">So far as numbers of living species are concerned, the Amphibia are the least
  numerous of the Vertebrata. There are about 40 limbless, burrowing <span class="sc">Apoda</span>;
  100 <span class="sc">Urodela</span> or tailed two- or four-footed newts, and about 900 <span
  class="sc">Anura</span>, or tailless, four-footed frogs and toads; in all some 1000 different
  species. Few, indeed, in comparison with the 2700 Mammals, 3500 Reptiles, nearly 8000 Fishes, and
  almost 10,000 Birds. But we shall see that the Amphibia have not only "had their day," having
  flourished in bygone ages when they divided the world, so far as Vertebrata were concerned,
  between themselves and the Fishes, but that they never attained a dominant position. Intermediate
  between the aquatic Fishes and the gradually rising terrestrial Reptiles they had to fight, so to
  speak, with a double front during the struggle of evolution, until by now most of them have become
  extinct. The rest persist literally in nooks and corners of the teeming world, and only the Frogs
  and Toads, the more recent branch of the Amphibian tree, have spread over the whole globe,
  exhibiting almost endless variations of the same narrow, much specialised plan. The greatest charm
  of the Anura lies in their marvellous adaptation to prevailing circumstances; and the nursing
  habits of some kinds read almost like fairy-tales.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Characters of the Amphibia.</b><a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>1. The vertebrae are (<i>a</i>) acentrous, (<i>b</i>) pseudocentrous, or (<i>c</i>)
    notocentrous.</p>
    <p>2. The skull articulates with the atlas by two condyles which are formed by the lateral
    occipitals. For exceptions see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page78">78</a></span>.</p>
    <p>3. There is an auditory columellar apparatus, fitting into the fenestra ovalis.</p>
    <p>4. The limbs are of the tetrapodous, pentadactyle type.</p>
    <p>5. The red blood-corpuscles are nucleated, biconvex, and oval.</p>
    <p>6. The heart is (<i>a</i>) divided into two atria and one ventricle, and (<i>b</i>) it has a
    conus provided with valves.</p>
    <p>7. The aortic arches are strictly symmetrical.</p>
    <p>8. Gills are present at least during some early stages of development.</p>
    <p>9. The kidneys are provided with persistent nephrostomes.</p>
    <p>10. Lateral sense-organs are present at least during the larval stage.</p>
    <p>11. The vagus is the last cranial nerve.</p>
    <p>12. The median fins, where present, are not supported by spinal skeletal rays.</p>
    <p>13. Sternal ribs and a costal or true sternum are absent.</p>
    <p>14. There is no paired or unpaired medio-ventral, copulatory apparatus.</p>
    <p>15. Development takes place without amnion and allantois.</p>
    <div class="bq2">
      <p>None of these characters is absolutely diagnostic, except 1 (<i>c</i>), and this applies
      only to the Anura and most of the Stegocephali.</p>
      <div><span class="pagenum" id="page5"><span class="smaller">{5}</span></span></div>
      <p>Numbers 1 (<i>b</i>), 1 (<i>c</i>), 2, 3, 4 and 12 separate the Amphibia from the
      Fishes.</p>
      <p>Numbers 1, 6 (<i>b</i>), 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15 separate them from the Reptiles, Birds, and
      Mammals.</p>
      <p>Number 2 separates them from the Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds.</p>
      <p>Number 5 separates them from the Mammals.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Number 6 (<i>a</i>) separates them from the Fishes (excl. Dipnoi), Birds and
      Mammals.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We can, therefore, very easily define all the Amphibia, both recent and extinct, by a
  combination of the characters enumerated above. For instance, by the combination of numbers 2, 3
  or 4 with either 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 or 15.</p>

  <p><i>Amphicondylous Anamnia</i> would be an absolutely correct and all-sufficient diagnosis, but
  it would be of little use in the determination of adult specimens; and the tetrapodous character
  is of no avail for Apoda. <i>Amphicondylous animals without an intracranial hypoglossal nerve</i>
  is a more practical diagnosis.</p>

  <p>In the case of living Urodela and Anura the absence of any scales in the skin affords a more
  popular character; it is unfortunately not applicable to the Apoda, many of which possess dermal
  scales, although these are hidden in the imbricating transverse rings of the epidermis; and the
  frequent occurrence of typical scales of both ecto- and meso-dermal composition in many of the
  Stegocephali forces us to discard the scales, or rather their absence, as a diagnostic character
  of the class Amphibia. The same applies to the mostly soft, moist, or clammy, and very glandular
  nature of the skin.</p>

  <p><b>The position of the class Amphibia in the Phylum Vertebrata.</b>&ndash;There is no doubt
  that the Amphibia have sprung from fish-like ancestors, and that they in turn have given rise to
  the Reptilia. The Amphibia consequently hold a very important intermediate position. It was
  perhaps not a fortunate innovation when Huxley brigaded them with the Fishes as
  <i>Ichthyopsida</i>, thereby separating them more from the <i>Sauropsida</i> (= Reptilia and
  Aves), than is justifiable,&ndash;perhaps more than he himself intended. The connecting-link, in
  any case, is formed by the Stegocephali; all the recent Orders, the Apoda, Urodela, and Anura, are
  far too specialised to have any claims to the direct ancestral connections. The line leading from
  Stegocephali to fossil Reptiles, notably to such Proreptilia as <i>Eryops</i> and <i>Cricotus</i>,
  and even to the Lepospondylous Prosauria, is extremely gradual, and the steps are almost
  imperceptible. Naturally, <span class="pagenum" id="page6"><span
  class="smaller">{6}</span></span>assuming evolution to be true, there must have lived countless
  creatures which were a "rudis indigestaque moles," neither Amphibia nor Reptilia, in the present
  intensified sense of the systematist. The same consideration applies equally to the line which
  leads downwards to the Fishes. But the great gulf within the Vertebrata lies between Fishes and
  Amphibia, between absolutely aquatic creatures with internal gills and "fins," and terrestrial,
  tetrapodous creatures, with lungs and fingers and toes. On the side of the fishes only the Dipnoi
  and the Crossopterygii come into consideration.</p>

  <p>The piscine descent of the Amphibia is still proclaimed by the following features.&ndash;(1)
  The possession by the heart of a long conus arteriosus, provided with, in many cases, numerous
  valves, or at least (Anura) one series at the base, another at the beginning of the truncus where
  the arterial arches branch off; (2) the strictly symmetrical arrangement of these arches; (3) the
  trilocular heart is still like that of the Lung-fishes or Dipnoi; (4) the occurrence of as many as
  four or even five branchial skeletal arches in the larval stage; (5) the glottis is supported by
  cartilages which themselves are derivatives of posterior visceral arches; (6) the development of
  the vertebrae (Stegocephali and Urodela) from four pairs of arcualia, and the formation of the
  intervertebral joints by a split across the intervertebral ring of cartilage: this feature is
  unknown in Reptilia, but it occurs also in <i>Lepidosteus</i>, most probably also in
  <i>Polypterus</i>; (7) the hypoglossal still retains the character of a post-cranial or cervical
  spinal nerve; (8) the presence of lateral sense-organs; (9) the possession of external gills is of
  somewhat doubtful phylogenetic value, although such gills occur amongst fishes only in Dipnoi and
  Crossopterygii. It is not unlikely that in the Amphibia these organs owe their origin to entirely
  larval requirements, while the suctorial mouth of the larvae of the Anura and many fishes has
  certainly no ancestral meaning, but is a case of convergent development.</p>

  <p>The usual diagnoses of the Amphibia contain the statement that they, or most of them, undergo a
  metamorphosis, or pass through a larval stage. The same applies to various fishes; while, on the
  other hand, the larval (not ancestral) stage has become permanent in the Proteidae and Sirenidae;
  and lastly, we cannot well speak of larvae in the viviparous <i>Salamandra atra</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page7"><span class="smaller">{7}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>The evolution of an adequate classification of the Amphibia</b> has been a long process.
  Even their recognition as a class, separate from, and of equal rank with that of, the Reptilia,
  was by no means generally accepted until comparatively recent times. A historical sketch of the
  laborious, often painful, striving for light, in France and Germany, then in England, and lastly
  in America, is not without interest.</p>

  <div class="bq1 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>The term <i>Amphibia</i> was invented by Linnaeus for the third class of animals in his
    famous "Systema Naturae." It comprises a very queer assembly, which, even in the 13th edition
    (1767), stands as follows:&ndash;</p>
    <div class="bq2">
      <p>1. <span class="sc">Reptiles pedati</span>, with the four "genera" <i>Testudo</i>,
      <i>Draco</i>, <i>Lacerta</i>, and <i>Rana</i>. <i>Lacerta</i> includes Crocodiles, Lizards,

      <p class="sp0">3. <span class="sc">Nantes pinnati.</span> Elasmobranchs, Sturgeons, Lampreys,
      and various other fishes.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Laurenti, 1768, in a dissertation entitled "Specimen medicum, exhibens Synopsin Reptilium
    ...," uses Brisson's term, <span class="sc">Reptiles</span>, and divides them into:&ndash;</p>
    <div class="bq2">
      <p><span class="sc">Reptilia salientia</span>, these are the Anura.</p>
      <p><span class="sc">Gradientia</span>, namely the Urodela and Lizards.</p>
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Serpentia</span>, the Snakes and the Apoda.</p>

    <p>Brongniart, 1800, "Essay d'une classification naturelle des Reptiles,"<a id="NtA_2"
    href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> distinguishes:&ndash;</p>
    <div class="bq2">

      class="sc">Ophidii</span>, <span class="sc">Batrachii</span>; the last for the Frogs, Toads,
      and Newts.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Latreille, 1804, "Nouveau Dict. Hist. Nat." xxiv.,<a id="NtA_3"
    href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> accepts the four Orders of Brongniart's "Reptiles," but clearly
    separates the fourth Order, "<span class="sc">Batrachii</span>," from the rest by the following,
    now time-honoured, diagnosis: <i>Doigts des pattes n'ayant pas d'ongles; des branchies, du moins
    pendant un temps; des m&eacute;tamorphoses</i>. But there is not one word about "Amphibia" in
    opposition to "Reptilia."</p>
    <p>Dum&eacute;ril, 1806, "Zoologie analytique" (p. 90), and "&Eacute;l&eacute;mens de l'histoire naturelle," 1807,
    divides the "Reptiles batraciens," or "Batracii," into <span class="sc">Ecaudati</span> and
    <span class="sc">Caudati</span>; he also introduces the terms "<span class="sc">Anoures</span>"
    and "<span class="sc">Urod&egrave;les</span>" as their equivalents; but since these terms appear in the
    French form purists do not admit their having any claim to recognition!</p>
    <p>Oppel, 1811, "Die Ordnungen, Familien und Gattungen der Reptilien," establishes the term
    <span class="sc">Apoda</span> for the Coeciliae, and recognises their affinity to the Ecaudata
    and Caudata by removing them from the Snakes.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae of the Urodela and those of the Apoda differ from those of all the other
  Tetrapoda<a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> by possessing no special centra or
  bodies. That part which should correspond with the centrum is formed either by the meeting and
  subsequent complete co-ossification of the two chief dorsal and ventral pairs of arcualia <span
  class="pagenum" id="page12"><span class="smaller">{12}</span></span>(tail-vertebrae), or entirely
  by the pair of chief dorsal arcualia. There is consequently no neuro-central suture. Moreover, the
  central region of each vertebra is strongly pinched in laterally, widening towards the ends.
  Another feature of the vertebral column of the Urodela is the possession of a considerable amount
  of intervertebral cartilage, by which the successive vertebrae are held together. This cartilage
  does not ossify, and it either remains continuous, serving in its entirety and owing to its
  flexibility as a joint, or it becomes more or less imperfectly separated into a cup and ball
  portion, the cup belonging to the posterior end of the vertebra. Such joints are called
  opisthocoelous, and occur in the Desmognathinae and Salamandrinae. In the adult the cup and ball
  frequently calcify, and the chorda dorsalis or notochord is completely destroyed. Those vertebrae
  between which the intervertebral cartilage remains unbroken, are called amphicoelous, since in
  them, most obviously in macerated or dried skeletons, the vertebrae appear hollowed out at either
  end. In such amphicoelous vertebrae a considerable amount of the chorda always remains, running in
  an unbroken string through the whole length of the vertebral column. Towards adult life the chorda
  becomes constricted, and is ultimately squeezed out or destroyed, in the middle of the vertebra,
  by the invasion of cartilage from the chief arcualia. This intravertebrally situated cartilage has
  been described erroneously as chordal cartilage.</p>

  <p>The development of the vertebrae proceeds as follows. First appear a pair of basidorsalia and a
  pair of basiventralia (Fig. 1, <span class="smaller">1</span>, B.D, B.V), blocks of cartilage,
  imbedded in and resting upon the thin sheath of the chorda dorsalis. Next appears a pair of
  interdorsal blocks, immediately behind the basidorsals; and somewhat later appears a pair of
  interventral blocks. These four pairs of cartilages or "<span class="gsp">arcualia</span>" each
  meet, above or below the chorda, and form semi-rings, which again by extending upwards or
  downwards fuse into complete rings, in such a way that the interdorsal and interventral elements
  form the intervertebral mass spoken of above. The basidorsals fuse with the basiventrals, and form
  the body of the vertebra, the fusion being effected chiefly by the calcification and ossification
  of the lateral connecting portion of the skeletogenous layer. The basidorsalia form the neural
  arches with their unpaired short spinous or neural, and the paired anterior and posterior
  zygapophysial processes. Concerning the <span class="pagenum" id="page13"><span
  class="smaller">{13}</span></span>basiventralia we have to distinguish between the trunk and the
  tail. In the latter they produce a pair of ventral outgrowths or haemapophyses, which ultimately
  enclose the caudal blood-vessels. In the trunk the basiventral blocks of cartilage are suppressed;
  they appear in the early larvae, but disappear during or even before metamorphosis.</p>

      III in 6 and 7; <i>R</i>, rib; <i>T</i>, in 7, rib-like tubercle on the first vertebra.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Towards the end of the tail the vertebrae diminish in size, and their constituent cartilages
  assume a more and more indifferent shape, until they become confluent into a continuous rod of
  cartilage, resembling in this respect the Dipnoi and Holocephali. A periodical revival of this
  rod, at least of its connective tissue, appears in the tail-filament of the male <i>Triton
  palmatus</i> during the breeding-season.</p>

  <p>The first vertebra, called the atlas, because it carries the head, is remarkable for the
  possession of an odontoid process. The latter is formed by a pair of cartilages and represents
  part of a vertebra, the dorsal portion of which seems to have been added to the occipital part of
  the cranium.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page14"><span class="smaller">{14}</span></span></div>

  <p>All the trunk-vertebrae, with the exception of the atlas, carry ribs, at least vestiges
  thereof. Owing to the early disappearance of the basiventral cartilages the capitular portions of
  the ribs are much reduced, and are mostly represented by strands of connective tissue only. The
  ribs develop therefore occasionally at some distance from the vertebral column, and that portion
  of the rib which in the metamorphosed young newt looks like the capitulum is to a great extent
  really its tuberculum. Witness the position of the vertebral artery, which still indicates the
  true foramen transversarium. The homologies of these parts are still more obscured by the fact
  that a new process grows out from the rib, by which the latter gains a new support upon a knob of
  the neural arch. Thus an additional foramen is formed, sometimes confounded with the true
  transverse canal. The meaning which underlies all these modifications is the broadening of the
  body, the ribs shifting their originally more ventral support towards the dorsal side. The whole
  process is intensified in the Anura; it is an initial stage of the notocentrous type of vertebrae.
  The transverse ossified processes of the adult are often much longer than the vestiges of the ribs
  themselves, and are somewhat complicated structures. They are composed first of the rib-bearing
  cartilaginous outgrowths of the neural arches; secondly, of a broad string of connective tissue
  which extends from the ventro-lateral corner of the perichordal skeletogenous layer to the
  ribs.</p>

  <p>The <b>shoulder-girdle</b> is extremely simple. It remains almost entirely cartilaginous, and
  the three constituent elements are not separated by sutures. Ossification is restricted to the
  base of the shaft of the scapula, and may extend thence over the glenoid cavity. The coracoids are
  broad, loosely overlap each other, and are "tenon and mortised" into the triangular or
  lozenge-shaped <span class="pagenum" id="page15"><span
  class="smaller">{15}</span></span>cartilaginous sternum, which latter has no connection with the
  ribs. The precoracoid is a large, flat process, directed forwards, not meeting its fellow; it is
  absent in <i>Siren</i>.</p>

  <p>The humerus articulates with both radius and ulna, and these two bones of the forearm remain
  separate. The elements which compose the wrist and hand exhibit an almost ideally simple
  arrangement, slightly varied by the frequent fusion of two or more neighbouring carpalia into one,
  and by the reduction of the number of fingers. Most frequently the intermedium and the ulnar
  carpal element fuse together, and there is more often one centrale instead of two. The wrist and
  hand of the Urodela represent, however, no longer the entirely primitive pentadactyle type, owing
  to the loss of one finger together with its metacarpal and carpal element. Comparison with the
  Anura makes it probable that the Urodela have lost the pollex, their four fingers being
  consequently the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. <i>Siren</i> has four or three fingers; <i>Proteus</i>
  has only three fingers and three large compound carpal cartilages. In <i>Amphiuma</i>, with either
  three or two fingers, the ulnare, intermedium, and carpale are fused together, the radiale with
  the neighbouring carpale. The number of phalanges in the four-fingered species is generally 2, 3,
  3, 2 respectively.</p>

  <p>The <b>pelvic girdle</b>.&ndash;The ilium stands vertically to the vertebral axis, slanting
  slightly forwards and downwards. It is attached by means of a rib to only one vertebra, and this
  ilio-sacral connection is acetabular in its position, <i>i.e.</i> it lies in the same transverse
  plane with the acetabulum, in other words vertically above it. The ventral portion of the pelvis
  is formed by one large continuous mass, the united pubo-ischia, the anterior or pubic portion of
  which extends forwards in the shape of a broad triangle (<i>Necturus</i>) or as a slender,
  stalked, <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped cartilage, the epipubis, which is often movably
  jointed at its base. The lateral portion of the pubic cartilage is always perforated by the nervus
  obturatorius. Ossification is restricted to the ischium and to the middle of the shaft of the
  ilium. The acetabular fossa for the femur is closed. The tibia and fibula remain separate. The
  foot is still more primitive than the anterior extremity, as the majority of Urodela possess the
  full complement of five toes, with 2, 2, 3, 3, 2 phalanges respectively. Concrescence of the
  tarsalia applies most frequently to the fourth and fifth distal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page16"><span class="smaller">{16}</span></span>and to the two centralia; exceptional, for
  instance, in <i>Cryptobranchus japonicus</i>, are as many as three centralia, but this is an
  individual, even a one-sided variation, as shown for instance by a specimen in the Cambridge
  Museum. Loss of the fifth toe occurs sporadically in genera of different groups, namely, in
  <i>Salamandrella</i>, <i>Batrachyperus</i>, <i>Salamandrina</i>, <i>Necturus</i>, <i>Manculus</i>,
  <i>Batrachoseps</i>. In <i>Amphiuma</i> the number is reduced to three or two; in <i>Proteus</i>
  to two; and in <i>Siren</i> the hind limbs, with their girdle, are altogether absent. Lastly, in
  some species of <i>Spelerpes</i> and <i>Batrachoseps</i> both fore and hind limbs have become so
  small as to be practically without function, parallel cases being found among various Scincidae
  and other Lizards.</p>

  <p>The <b>hyoid apparatus</b> is still very primitive in many, especially in larval, Urodela.
  Besides the hyoid there are as many as four pairs of branchial arches, which, however, decrease in
  size and completeness, so that the last two have lost their connection with the median copular
  piece, and become attached in various ways to the second branchial arch. This is the arrangement
  apparently in all larvae, but four pairs of branchials persist in the adult <i>Siren</i>,
  <i>Amphiuma</i>, and <i>Cryptobranchus alleghaniensis</i>. The whole branchial apparatus is
  reduced to three pairs of arches in <i>Necturus</i> and <i>Proteus</i>, to two in the adult
  <i>Cryptobranchus japonicus</i> and in the Salamandridae. Of considerable interest is the vestige
  of a fifth pair of arches in the larvae of <i>Triton</i> and <i>Salamandra</i>, in the shape of a
  pair of tiny cartilages, which lie in front and on each side of the opening of the trachea, and
  give rise to the formation of the laryngeal cartilages, better developed in the higher
  Vertebrata.</p>

  <p>The following are noteworthy characters of the <b>skull of Urodela</b>. The articulation of the
  skull with the vertebral column is not always effected entirely by the two condyles of the lateral
  occipital bones, but the median basal cartilage often possesses a pair of facets for the
  odontoid-like process of the first vertebra; such additional facets are perhaps best developed in
  <i>Cryptobranchus</i> and in the Salamandrinae.</p>

  <p>The middle portion of the primitive cranium, from the exit of the optic nerve to the ethmoid
  cartilage, is formed by a pair of separate bones, the orbito-sphenoids. The parietal and frontal
  bones remain separate. One or more periotic bones exist, besides the prootic, in the aquatic
  families.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page17"><span class="smaller">{17}</span></span></div>

  <p>A pair of prefrontal bones is present in most Salamandridae, e.g. <i>Salamandra</i>,
  <i>Triton</i>, <i>Amblystoma</i>, especially in the larva, and in <i>Cryptobranchus</i>; these
  bones are absent in <i>Amphiuma</i>, <i>Necturus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Siren</i>.</p>

  <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Siren</i>. The parasphenoid is furnished with teeth in the Plethodontinae
  and Desmognathinae.</p>

  <p>Separate palatine bones exist in <i>Necturus</i> and <i>Proteus</i>, and in the larva of
  <i>Amblystoma</i>, but in the adult form they fuse with the vomers, producing the vomero-palatines
  characteristic of the majority of Urodela.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page18"><span class="smaller">{18}</span></span></div>

  <p>The pterygoid bones are most fully developed, so as to reach the vomero-palatines, in the
  Amblystomatinae, in <i>Necturus</i>, and in <i>Proteus</i>; they are reduced, so as to leave a
  gap, in <i>Cryptobranchus</i>, and still more in the Salamandrinae; they are absent in
  <i>Amphiuma</i> and in <i>Siren</i>.</p>

  <p>The quadrates are directed forwards in <i>Necturus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Siren</i>, while
  in the other Urodela they extend transversely and almost horizontally. The hyomandibular remnant,
  the so-called operculum, is small, and forms a plate which fits into the fenestra ovalis,
  extending as a ligamentous process upon the quadrate.</p>

  <p>The quadrato-jugal elements are reduced to ligaments. In many Salamandrinae the large
  orbito-temporal space is divided into an orbital and a temporal fossa by an arch which is formed
  by the meeting of two corresponding processes from the squamosal and frontal bones respectively.
  This bridge is rarely bony (<i>Salamandrina</i>, <i>Triton</i>), mostly
  ligamentous;&ndash;apparently a reminiscence of the Stegocephalous condition. The two premaxillary
  bones are liable to fuse into one, for instance in <i>Cryptobranchus</i>, generally in adult
  Tritons. They are most reduced, and are toothless, in <i>Siren</i>.</p>

  <p>The two maxillary bones are absent only in <i>Necturus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Typhlomolge</i>,
  and <i>Siren</i>. Their posterior end is frequently free, loosely connected by ligaments with the
  pterygoid in <i>Cryptobranchus</i>; or with the distal portion of the quadrate, and in this case
  either just touching it (<i>Tylototriton</i>), or forming a broad junction
  (<i>Pachytriton</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">Each half of the lower jaw consists of a dentary, articular and angulo-splenial.
  The splenial remains as a separate element in <i>Siren</i>; in others only during the larval
  period. There are no mento-Meckelian elements.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Skeleton of the Anura</span></p>

  <p><b>The vertebral column.</b>&ndash;The distinctive peculiarities of the vertebrae of the Anura
  are that they are notocentrous, and that about a dozen of them are modified and fused into an os
  coccygeum. The whole column is the most specialised found in the Vertebrata; and various stages
  are rapidly hurried through and obscured caenogenetically during the embryonic development. Paired
  cartilages appear on the dorsal side of the thin chordal sheath, and whilst tending to enclose the
  spinal cord in a <span class="pagenum" id="page19"><span class="smaller">{19}</span></span>canal,
  their bases grow head- and tail-wards into what will ultimately become the intervertebral region.
  This extension of cartilage leads to a fusion with that of the next following pair of arches, so
  that the axial column at this early stage consists of a right and left longitudinal ridge of
  cartilage which sends off dorsal processes, neural arches, in metameric succession. Next, the
  intervertebral cartilage increases in such a way as to constrict the chorda either laterally
  (<i>Rana</i>) or obliquely from above downwards and inwards (<i>Bufo</i>, <i>Hyla</i>). We
  recognise in this cartilage the interdorsalia. Ventral arcualia are late and much obscured. There
  is scarcely any cartilage which could represent the interventralia, the intervertebral cartilage
  being almost entirely made up of the interdorsalia. These fuse together and form a disc or nodule,
  which later fuses either with the vertebra in front, and in this case fits into a cup carried by
  the vertebra next behind (procoelous vertebrae), or the knob is added to the front end of the
  vertebra, fitting into a cup formed by the tail end of the vertebra next in front (opisthocoelous
  vertebrae). Much later than the two longitudinal dorsal bands there appears on the ventral side an
  unpaired band in which appear metamerically repeated swellings of cartilage, likewise unpaired.
  These swellings become confluent, in a way similar to that which produced the dorsal bands, and
  form the unpaired ventral band of cartilage, the hypochordal cartilage of some authors. The
  swellings in this band, equivalent to the basiventralia, become semilunar in a transverse view,
  their horns tending upwards towards the basidorsal cartilages, but there is no actual meeting.
  Both dorsal and ventral elements are, however, joined together and form the chief portion of the
  vertebrae, owing to the rapidly proceeding calcification and later ossification of the
  all-surrounding "membrana reuniens" or skeletogenous layer so far as that is not
  cartilaginous.</p>

  <p>Procoelous vertebrae exist in the overwhelming majority of Anura; opisthocoelous are those of
  the Aglossa, the Discoglossidae, and of some Pelobatidae. The systematic value of this pro- or
  opistho-coelous character has been much exaggerated. We have seen that the centra of the vertebrae
  of the Anura are formed entirely by the interdorsal elements, hence the term "<span
  class="gsp">notocentrous</span>," and these centra sometimes remain in adult specimens of
  <i>Pelobates</i> as separately ossified and calcified pieces, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page20"><span class="smaller">{20}</span></span>not fused with the rest of the vertebrae. This
  important discovery has been made by Boulenger, but Stannius had previously mentioned a specimen
  of <i>Pelobates</i> in which the second and fourth vertebrae are biconvex, the third, sixth, and
  eighth biconcave. Moreover, since the sacral vertebra, generally the ninth, in all the Anura is
  invariably biconvex, the eighth being biconcave in the procoelous families, opisthocoelous like
  the remaining seven vertebrae in the other families, it is not difficult to imagine that in the
  Anura the production of pro- or opistho-coelous vertebrae depends simply upon the centra or
  articulating knobs happening to fuse either with the hind or the front end of the vertebrae. This
  must of course ultimately be determined by a mechanical problem of motion.</p>

  <p>A second type of the vertebrae amongst the Anura is the <span class="gsp">epichordal</span>
  type, an exaggeration in degree of the notocentrous tendencies of the more usual perichordal
  arrangement. It shows, namely, the almost complete suppression of all the ventral cartilaginous
  elements, so that the chorda remains for a long time on the ventral surface of the axial column in
  the shape of a flattened longitudinal band. These two types are not unconnected. The suppression
  of the ventral elements applies most typically to the trunk region, while hypochordal cartilage
  exists in the anterior cervical vertebrae, and above all in the coccyx. Typically epichordal are
  the vertebrae of <i>Pipa</i>, <i>Xenopus</i>, <i>Bombinator</i>, <i>Pelobates</i>,
  <i>Discoglossus</i> and <i>Alytes</i>. It is significant that the epichordal often coincide with
  opisthocoelous vertebrae, and still more suggestive is the fact that <i>Bombinator</i> is
  eminently aquatic, <i>Pipa</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> entirely so, having lost the tympanum, at least
  externally. The epichordal feature is not necessarily indicative of relationship. It has probably
  been developed independently in various groups, in correlation with a resumption of aquatic life.
  Various genera of Pelobatidae and most likely some Cystignathidae, e.g. <i>Pseudis</i>, will not
  improbably connect the two types and their several correlated features, for instance, the frequent
  reduction of the tympanic cavity.</p>

  <p>The <span class="gsp">os coccygeum</span> has retained rather primitive features in so far as
  much dorsal and ventral cartilage is developed; but this has almost entirely lost its metameric
  arrangement, and the posterior half of the coccyx is formed chiefly by the ventral mass of
  cartilage, while the dorsal elements are more or less reduced. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page21"><span class="smaller">{21}</span></span>Only two vertebrae, generally the tenth and
  eleventh of the whole column, are clearly visible, each being composed of a pair of dorsal and a
  pair of ventral cartilaginous blocks. The sacral vertebra articulates with the coccyx by one or
  two convexities, but in the Aglossa, in some Pelobatidae, and a few others, the coccyx is fused
  with the sacral vertebra. Beyond the first and second component vertebrae of the embryonic coccyx,
  the cartilage is continued in the shape of two dorsal, and one ventral, bands, which soon fuse
  with each other. Dorsally this cartilage surrounds the spinal cord; the latter degenerates towards
  the end of the tadpole-stage, leaving, however, the empty spinal canal. The chorda, completely
  surrounded by cartilage, persists into the post-larval stage, but is destroyed long before the
  creature attains maturity. Ultimately the whole coccyx ossifies.</p>

  <p>The tail proper, namely that portion which is absorbed during the metamorphosis, remains
  throughout its existence in an apparently primitive condition. The chorda dorsalis and the spinal
  cord extend through its whole length, surrounded by continuous connective tissue without any
  cartilage; in fact it represents a piece of typical vertebral column before the appearance of
  cartilage. The reduction of this swimming organ begins at the hind end.</p>

  <p><span class="gsp">The vertebral column of the adult.</span>&ndash;The first vertebra (we will
  call it the atlas since it carries the skull) is not, as in the Urodela, provided with an odontoid
  process. It articulates by two cups with the condyles of the occiput. In some Anura it
  co-ossifies, rather incompletely, with the second vertebra, regularly in the fossil
  <i>Palaeobatrachus</i>, often in <i>Ceratophrys</i>, <i>Breviceps</i>, and occasionally in
  <i>Pelobates</i>, <i>Bufo</i>, <i>Rana</i>, and <i>Xenopus</i>. This is, however, no justification
  for looking upon the first vertebra as a complex of two vertebrae, although the atlas is
  frequently very thick and broad, and even carries, in the Aglossa, considerable lateral wings or
  diapophyses. Those of the trunk-vertebrae are often very long, acting thereby as substitutes for
  ribs which are absent, except on the second, third, and fourth vertebrae of the Discoglossidae,
  and on the second and third of the Aglossa. In the adult Aglossa these ribs fuse with the
  processes which carry them.</p>

  <p>The diapophyses of the sacral vertebra carry no ribs, the ilia being attached to them directly.
  They are either cylindrical <span class="pagenum" id="page22"><span
  class="smaller">{22}</span></span>as in the Ranidae and Cystignathidae, or they are more or less
  dilated as in all the other families, most strongly in the Pelobatidae and the Aglossa. In some
  members of the large sub-family of the Cystignathidae the otherwise cylindrical diapophyses are
  slightly dilated.</p>

  <p>The sacrum is formed by the ninth vertebra, but there are a few interesting exceptions.
  <i>Pelobates</i>, <i>Pipa</i>, and <i>Hymenochirus</i> possess two sacral vertebrae; and,
  neglecting individual abnormalities, these three genera form the only exception amongst recent
  Amphibia. In the three genera the coccyx is fused with the second sacral vertebra, and such a
  fusion occurs elsewhere normally only in <i>Bombinator</i> with its single sacral vertebra. The
  morphologically oldest condition is normally represented by <i>Pelobates</i>, the sacral vertebrae
  being the tenth and ninth. One case has been recorded by Boulenger of <i>Bombinator pachypus</i>
  "with eleven segments," the last carrying the ilium. Individual lop-sided abnormalities have been
  described in <i>Bombinator</i> and <i>Alytes</i>, where the right ilium articulated with the
  tenth, the left ilium with the ninth vertebra. This shifting forwards of the ilium to the extent
  of one metamere has been continued further in <i>Pipa</i>, in which the sacrum is formed by the
  ninth and eighth vertebrae, their diapophyses fusing on either side into extra broad wing-like
  expansions. In old specimens of <i>Palaeobatrachus fritschi</i> the seventh vertebra is in a
  transitional condition, the ilium being carried by the ninth and eighth, and slightly also by the
  diapophyses of the seventh vertebra; and in <i>P. diluvianus</i> the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page23"><span class="smaller">{23}</span></span>diapophyses of all these vertebrae are united
  into one broad plate to which the ilia are attached. Lastly, in <i>Hymenochirus</i> the first
  sacral is the sixth vertebra, and this creature has thereby reduced the pre-sacral vertebrae to
  the smallest number known.</p>

  <p>This shifting forwards of the iliac attachment implies the conversion of original trunk into
  sacral vertebrae, and the original sacral vertebra itself becomes ultimately added to the
  urostyle. The second sacral, the tenth of <i>Pelobates</i>, the ninth of <i>Pipa</i>, and the
  tenth on the right side of the abnormal <i>Bombinator</i>, are still in a transitional stage of
  conversion. In Discoglossidae the tenth is already a typical post-sacral vertebra, and is added to
  the coccyx, but it still retains distinct, though short, diapophyses. In the majority of the Anura
  the tenth vertebra has lost these processes, and its once separate nature is visible in young
  specimens only. In <i>Bombinator</i> even the eleventh vertebra is free during the larval stage.
  In fact the whole coccyx is the result of the fusion of about twelve or more vertebrae, which from
  behind forwards have lost their individuality. We conclude that originally, in the early Anura,
  there was no coccyx, and that the ilium was attached much farther back; and this condition, and
  the gradual shifting forwards, supply an intelligible cause of the formation of an os coccygeum.
  The fact that the sacral vertebrae of the Anura possess no traces of ribs as carriers of the ilia,
  is also very suggestive. The ilia have shifted into a region, the vertebrae of which had already
  lost their ribs. By reconstructing the vertebral column of the Anura, by dissolving the coccyx
  into about a dozen vertebrae, so that originally, say the twenty-first vertebra carried the ilia,
  we bridge over the enormous gap which exists between the Anura and Urodela. That whole portion of
  the axial continuation behind the coccyx, more or less coinciding with the position of the vent,
  is the transitional tail.</p>

  <p>The disappearance of both notochord and spinal cord, and the conversion of the cartilaginous
  elements into a continuous rod in the case of the os coccygeum, find an analogy in the hinder
  portion of the tail of Dipnoi and Crossopterygii, and in the tail-end of most Urodela, portions
  which are not homologous with the os coccygeum. The term urostyle should be restricted to such and
  similar modifications of the tail-end, and this latter happens to be lost by the Anura during
  metamorphosis.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page24"><span class="smaller">{24}</span></span></div>

  <p>Strictly speaking, or rather in anatomical parlance, the Vertebrate tail begins with the first
  post-sacral vertebra. In the Anura that portion of the whole tail has retained most cartilage, and
  has become the coccygeum, which is required as a "backbone" for the often enormous belly. This
  requirement is an outcome of the great shortening of the trunk proper (if the trunk be defined as
  ending with the pelvic region), and this shortening of the trunk is again intimately connected
  with the jumping mechanism, enlargement of the hind-limbs, elongation of the ilia, and throwing
  the fulcral attachment forwards as much as possible. The pre-acetabular ilio-sacral connection is
  carried to the extreme in the Anura.</p>

  <p>The <b>shoulder-girdle</b> and "sternum" are more complete than in the Urodela, there being
  also a pair of clavicles, fused with the precoracoidal bars. The whole apparatus presents two
  types. In the <span class="gsp">arciferous type</span> the coracoids and precoracoids retain a
  great amount of cartilage in their distal portions, and these cartilages (the epicoracoids of some
  authors) overlap each other movably on one another, the right usually lying ventrally upon the
  left. The epicoracoidal cartilage of each side, by connecting the distal end of the coracoid with
  the precoracoid of the same side, forms an arc, hence "arciferous." In the <span
  class="gsp">firmisternal type</span> the epicoracoidal cartilages are much reduced, and, instead
  of overlapping, meet in the middle line and often fuse with each other, forming thereby a firm
  median bar, which connects the ventral ends of the precoracoids with those of the coracoids. This
  type is morphologically the higher and more recent, and passes in the larval stage through the
  arciferous condition. It is restricted to the Ranidae, Engystomatinae, and Aglossa. Although these
  two types afford an excellent distinctive character for the main divisions of the Anura, they are
  to a certain extent connected by intermediate forms in such a way, that, for instance, in
  <i>Bufo</i> and among Cystignathidae in <i>Ceratophrys</i>, the two opposite epicoracoidal
  cartilages begin to unite at the anterior end.</p>

  <p>In many Engystomatinae the precoracoids together with the clavicles are much reduced, sometimes
  to thin ligaments, being in this case mostly curved back and lying closely against the coracoids;
  or they may be lost completely. Very rarely the precoracoidal bars are actually much stronger than
  the coracoids, <span class="pagenum" id="page25"><span class="smaller">{25}</span></span>and the
  median symphysial bar of cartilage is lost; this is the case in <i>Hemisus</i>.</p>

  <p>The scapula is always large and curved into transverse, dorsally broadening blades, the dorsal
  greater portion of which, the so-called supra-scapula, does not ossify but calcifies.</p>

  <p>It is very doubtful if the Anura possess a true sternum, if by sternum we understand a
  medio-ventral apparatus which owes its origin to the ventral portions of ribs. The so-called
  sternal apparatus of the Anura consists of two pieces. One, anterior, variously named episternum,
  presternum, or omosternum, rests upon the united precoracoids and extends headwards, being either
  styliform or broadened out. Sometimes it is partly ossified, with a distinct suture at its base;
  this is the case especially in the Firmisternia; in many Arcifera the omosternum remains
  cartilaginous and is continuous, without a sutural break, with the cartilage of the precoracoids,
  indicating thereby its genetic relation to the shoulder-girdle. Hence <i>omosternum</i> is the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page26"><span class="smaller">{26}</span></span>preferable name. It is
  frequently much reduced, even absent, for instance in most Bufonidae and in the Engystomatinae.
  The posterior so-called sternal part may be termed <i>metasternum</i>. It forms the posterior
  counterpart of the omosternum. It is attached behind to the epicoracoidal cartilages, or fusing
  with them forms their posterior continuation. It appears mostly in the shape of a style, which is
  frequently ossified, and broadens out behind into a cartilaginous, partly calcified blade. In the
  Discoglossidae only it diverges backwards into two horns, assuming a striking resemblance to the
  typical xiphisternum of the Amniota. In young Anura the metasternal cartilage is intimately
  connected with the pericardium, an indication of its being derived not from ribs but from the
  shoulder-girdle.</p>

  <p>The glenoid cavity is always formed by the coracoids and by the scapula, but the precoracoid
  often takes part in its formation, for instance in Bufonidae, Hylidae, and Discoglossidae.</p>

  <p>In the <b>fore-limb</b> the humerus has a crest, stronger in the males than in the females; it
  assumes extraordinary strength in some Cystignathidae, notably in the male <i>Leptodactylus</i>.
  Radius and ulna are fused into one bone. The carpalia are originally nine in number: radiale,
  ulnare, two centralia, and five carpalia distalia, the fifth of which is reduced to a tiny nodule
  or to a ligamentous vestige. The primitive condition still prevails in the Discoglossidae. In most
  of the other Anura the fourth and third distal carpalia, in any case very small, fuse with the
  enlarged ulnar centrale; the radial centrale comes, in the Bufonidae and Pelobatidae, into contact
  with the radius, so that the forearm articulates with three elements as in the Urodela, but with
  this difference, that the intermedium of the Urodela has been lost by the Anura. There are five
  metacarpalia and five fingers, but the elements of the first or thumb are nearly vestigial, so
  that the pollux is reduced to one or two nodules, scarcely visible externally. The normal number
  of the phalanges of the second to fifth fingers is 2, 2, 3, 3. The distal phalanges are generally
  straight, either pointed or expanded or with <span class="sans fwb">Y</span> or <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped ends; but in the Hylidae, in <i>Hylambates</i> amongst the Ranidae, and in
  <i>Ceratohyla</i>, one of the Hemiphractinae, the terminal phalanges are produced into curved
  claws which support the adhesive finger-discs. There are, however, many genera of different
  families, which possess finger-discs and have no claw-shaped <span class="pagenum"
  id="page27"><span class="smaller">{27}</span></span>phalanges. The Hylidae, and many of the
  climbing members of the Ranidae with adhesive discs, possess an extra skeletal piece intercalated
  between the last and last but one phalanges of the fingers and toes. This piece, a mere
  interarticular cartilage in <i>Hyla</i>, is in the following Raninae developed into an additional
  phalanx, so that their numbers are 3, 3, 4, 4 in the hand and 3, 3, 4, 5, 4 in the foot:
  <i>Cassina</i>, <i>Hylambates</i>, <i>Rappia</i>, <i>Megalixalus</i>, <i>Rhacophorus</i>,
  <i>Chiromantis</i>, <i>Ixalus</i>, and <i>Nyctixalus</i>. All the other Ranidae are without this
  additional phalanx, irrespective of the presence or absence or size of digital expansions.<a
  id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>pelvic girdle</b> looks like a pair of tongs (see Fig. 4, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page22">22</a></span>). The ilium is enormously elongated and is movably attached to the
  sacral diapophyses. This connection is always pre-acetabular in position. The ilium and ischium
  co-ossify completely, and make up nearly the whole of the pelvis; the pubis is very small, and
  remains cartilaginous unless it calcifies. It rarely possesses a centre of ossification, for
  instance in <i>Pelobates</i>, where the osseous nodule is excluded from the acetabulum, recalling
  certain Labyrinthodonta, whose ossa pubis likewise do not reach that cavity. The latter is open or
  perforated in young Anura and remains so in the Discoglossidae, but in the others it becomes
  closed up as in the Urodela. The ventral halves of the pelvis, besides forming a symphysis,
  closely approach each other, just leaving room for the passage of the rectum and the urino-genital
  ducts.</p>

  <p>The <b>hind-limbs</b> are in all cases longer than the fore-limbs. The femur is slender, the
  tibia and fibula are fused into one bone. The tarsus is much modified by the great elongation of
  the two proximal tarsalia (there being no intermedium) into an astragalus and a calcaneum, both of
  which fuse together distally and proximally, or completely as in <i>Pelodytes</i>; in the latter
  case the limb assumes a unique appearance, since it consists of three successive and apparently
  single bars of nearly equal length. The other tarsal elements, especially the more lateral ones,
  are practically reduced to pads. The Anura have thereby acquired two well-marked joints, one
  cruro-tarsal, the other tarso-metatarsal; this shows a high stage of specialisation in comparison
  with the Urodelous and Stegocephalous type of still undefined joints.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page28"><span class="smaller">{28}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Anura possesses five well-developed toes with normally 2, 2, 3, 4, and 3 phalanges, and the
  rudiments of a sixth digit, the so-called prehallux, which consists of from two to four pieces,
  including the one which represents its metatarsal. This prehallux, as a vestige of a once better
  developed digit, is exactly like the elements on the radial side of the wrist, which, we are
  certain, are the remnants of a once complete finger, namely the pollex. The only weighty
  difficulty against its interpretation as a prehallux lies in the fact that hitherto no six-toed
  Stegocephali have been found; but the fact that there are no Stegocephali known with more than
  four fingers could be used as an argument against there being a pollex-vestige in recent Anura
  with just as little reason.</p>

  <p>The <b>skull</b> of the Anura differs from that of the other recent Amphibia in the following
  features:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The orbital region of the primitive cranium remains cartilaginous, but further forward the
  cranial cavity is closed by the unpaired sphenethmoid, which forms a ring round the anterior
  portion of the brain-cavity, hence called "os en ceinture" by some anatomists. The frontals and
  parietals fuse into one pair of fronto-parietal bones, and these again can fuse together in the
  middle line; as in Aglossa and <i>Pelobates</i>. The palatal portion of the palato-quadrate
  cartilage is complete, reaching forwards to the sides of the ethmoid region. The curved arch,
  formed by this cartilage, is covered by the following bones: (1) the quadrato-jugal, reduced to a
  thin splint which connects the quadrate and squamosal with the posterior end of the maxilla; (2)
  the pterygoid, always strong, extending from the distal inner corner of the quadrate to the
  maxilla, sometimes also to the palatine, and with a broad, median process to the parasphenoid,
  this process covering ventrally most of the otic region; (3) the palatines, which vary
  considerably in shape and size; they are placed transversely and meet in the middle line; in
  <i>Bombinator</i> and <i>Pelodytes</i> they are absent.</p>

  <p>The quadrates are directed transversely and backwards, in conformity with the wide gape of the
  mouth. The squamosal is always well developed, covering the whole of the quadrate on its outer
  side; it has a forwardly directed process which ends freely in <i>Rana</i>, meets a corresponding
  process of the maxilla and forms a bony arch with it in <i>Discoglossus</i>, <i>Pelobates</i>, and
  others, or <span class="pagenum" id="page29"><span class="smaller">{29}</span></span>is scarcely
  developed at all, for instance in <i>Bufo</i>. In <i>Pelobates cultripes</i> the squamosal is very
  wide and forms a junction with the fronto-parietals, thus producing a broad bridge across the
  temporal fossa.</p>

  <p>The nasal bones are large and meet in the middle line. Frequently they leave a space between
  them and the diverging anterior portion of the fronto-parietals, through which gap appears part of
  the dorsal surface of the ethmoid cartilage. A fontanelle between the frontals occurs in most
  Hylidae, many Cystignathidae, some few Bufonidae, in <i>Pelodytes</i> amongst the Pelobatidae, and
  in the Discoglossidae.</p>

  <p>The tympanic cavity is bordered in front, above, and below by the squamosal and quadrate,
  behind by the musculus depressor mandibulae, internally by the otic capsule, and by the cartilage
  of the cranium between this and the lateral occipital bone. The cavity communicates, however, by
  the wide and short Eustachian tube with the mouth, the passage being bordered anteriorly by the
  pterygoid, posteriorly by soft parts. Partly imbedded in these soft tissues is the styloid process
  or stylohyal, which is attached to the cranium, mostly behind the otic region, and is continued
  downwards into the anterior horn of the hyoid. The whole partly cartilaginous, ligamentous, and
  osseous string is, in fact, the entire ventral half of the hyoid arch, while the dorsal half or
  hyomandibular portion of this, the second visceral arch, is modified into the columellar or
  auditory chain. The inner end of this chain, the stapes, is inserted into and around the fenestra
  ovalis of the otic capsule, while the outer end is somewhat <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped, and is loosely attached to or near the upper rim of the tympanic ring and to
  the middle of the tympanic disc. In many Anura this terminal bar can be seen from the outside. The
  middle portion of the columellar chain is ossified, the rest remains cartilaginous. But the whole
  chain exhibits various modifications in different genera, especially in the number and the extent
  of the processes sent out by the outer cartilaginous portion; these are attached in various ways
  to the tympanum and its rims. The tympanic disc is carried by a cartilaginous ring, which rests
  against a special process sent out by the quadrate, and is probably itself a differentiation of
  this element.</p>

  <p>In some very aquatic genera, but also in <i>Pelobates</i>, the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page30"><span class="smaller">{30}</span></span>tympanic cavity is much reduced, for instance
  in <i>Bombinator</i>, <i>Liopelma</i>. In <i>Batrachophrynus</i> not only the cavity, but also the
  Eustachian tubes are suppressed. In the Aglossa only the two tubes are united into one short but
  wide median canal, opening at the level of the pterygoids on the roof of the mouth.</p>

  <p>The lower jaw is remarkable for the possession of mento-Meckelian cartilages, absent only in
  the Aglossa and Discoglossidae. At first they are much longer than the rest of the jaw; during the
  larval life they indeed form the functional jaw, and they are now covered with horny sheaths
  instead of teeth. Owing to the absence of teeth on them, these mento-Meckelian cartilages are
  later not invested by bone, although in many Anura they ultimately ossify, either retaining their
  separate nature or fusing partly with the dentary bones. The bulk of the lower jaw, the Meckelian
  cartilage, becomes invested by the dentary, a small articulare, and an inner angulare, while a
  splenial element is absent. The dentary itself is mostly reduced to a small dentigerous splint,
  while the angulare forms by far the greater part of the bony jaw.</p>

  <p>Teeth are more restricted in their occurrence than in the Urodela. On the jaws they always
  stand in one row. With the exception of the Hemiphractinae, Amphignathodontinae,
  Ceratobatrachinae, and Genyophryninae, no recent Anura carry teeth on the lower jaw, and even in
  these genera they are mostly much reduced in size and firmness, having all the appearance of
  vanishing structures. The premaxillae and maxillae are frequently furnished with teeth, except in
  the Dendrobatinae, Genyophryninae, Engystomatinae, Dendrophryniscinae, Bufonidae, <i>Pipa</i>, and
  <i>Hymenochirus</i>. The vomers mostly carry a series of teeth on their posterior border; when
  these teeth are absent, as in many species of <i>Bufo</i>, a kind of substitute sometimes occurs
  on the palatines in the shape of a row of tuberosities. The palatines carry teeth in
  Hemiphractinae. The parasphenoids are rarely toothed, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Triprion</i>,
  <i>Diaglena</i>, <i>Amphodus</i>, and occasionally in <i>Pelobates</i>.</p>

  <p>A few Anura possess peculiar substitutes for teeth in the anterior portion of the lower jaw,
  namely, a pair of conical bony processes, sometimes rather long, but always covered by the dense
  gums, or investment of the jaws; <i>e.g.</i> <i>Lepidobatrachus</i>, several Rana, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>R. adspersa</i>, <i>R. khasiana</i>, <i>R. kuhli</i>, and <i>Cryptotis brevis</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page31"><span class="smaller">{31}</span></span></div>

  <p>Cranial dermal ossifications are developed in some species of <i>Bufo</i>, still more in the
  Hemiphractinae, and above all in <i>Pelobates cultripes</i> and in the Cystignathoid genus
  <i>Calyptocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <b>hyoid apparatus</b> of the Anura is complicated. It is originally composed
  of the hyoidean and four branchial arches, with one median, copular piece. The branchial arches
  form in the early life of the tadpole the elaborate framework of the filtering apparatus mentioned
  on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page44">44</a></span>. During metamorphosis the whole filter
  disappears, owing to resorption of the greater part of the branchial arches; only their median
  portions remain, and fuse with the enlarged copular piece and the hyoidean arches into a broad
  shield-shaped cartilage (<i>corpus linguae</i>), whence several lateral processes sprout out, the
  posterior pair of which are generally called thyrohyals or thyroid horns. The true hyoid horns
  give up their larval lean-to articulation with the quadrate, become greatly elongated, and gain a
  new attachment on the otic region of the cranium. The transformation of the whole apparatus has
  been studied minutely by Ridewood, in <i>Pelodytes punctatus</i>.<a id="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Skin</span></p>

  <p>The epidermis of the young larvae of Amphibia is furnished with cilia, which later on are
  suppressed by the development of a thin hyaline layer or cuticula, but clusters of such cilia
  remain, at least during the larval life and during the periodical aquatic life of the adult, in
  the epidermal sense-organs. In the frog, currents are set up by the ciliary action at an earlier
  stage, and are maintained to a later stage than in the newt. In the latter the tail loses its
  ciliation, whereas in the frog it remains active almost up to the time of the metamorphosis. In
  tadpoles of 3-10 mm. nearly the whole surface is ciliated (Assheton).<a id="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The cilia work from head to tail, causing the little animal,
  when perfectly quiet, to move forwards slowly in the water. Beneath the cuticula, in the
  Perennibranchiata and the larvae of the other Urodela, lies a somewhat thicker layer of vertically
  striated cells, the so-called pseudo-cuticula, which disappears with the transformation of the
  upper layers of the Malpighian cells into the stratum corneum. The latter is very thin, consists
  of one or two layers of flattened cells, and is shed periodically by all <span class="pagenum"
  id="page32"><span class="smaller">{32}</span></span>Amphibia in one piece. In the Urodela it
  generally breaks loose around the mouth, and the animal slips out of the delicate, transparent,
  colourless "shirt," which during this process of ecdysis or moulting becomes inverted. In the
  Anura it mostly breaks along the middle line of the back, the creature struggles out of it, pokes
  it into its mouth, and swallows it. Urodela also eat this skin. As a rule the first ecdysis takes
  place towards the end of the metamorphosis, preparatory to terrestrial life. So long as the animal
  grows rapidly, the skin has to be shed frequently, since this corneous layer is practically dead
  and unyielding. Adult terrestrial Urodela do not seem to moult often, mostly only when they take
  to the water in the breeding season. Anura, on the other hand, moult often on land, at least every
  few months. The surface of the new skin is then quite moist and slimy, but it soon dries and
  hardens.</p>

  <p>The Malpighian stratum consists of several layers, thickest in the Perennibranchiata; in them
  it contains mucous cells throughout life, in others such slime-cells are restricted to larval
  life. Later, regular slime-glands are developed, which open on the surface. They are very
  numerous, and more evenly distributed, over most parts of the body, than the specific or
  poison-glands, which are restricted to certain parts, often forming large clusters, especially on
  the sides of the body. They reach their greatest development in the "parotoid glands" of the
  Anura. Both kinds of glands are furnished with smooth muscle-fibres, which are said to arise from
  the basal membrane underlying and forming part of the Malpighian layer; these muscle-cells extend
  later downwards into the corium. For the action of the poison, see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page37">37</a></span>.</p>

  <p>The stratum corneum is mostly thin, but on many parts of the body, especially in Anura, the
  epidermal cells proliferate and form hard spikes or other rugosities, generally stained dark
  brown. With these may be grouped the nuptial excrescences so frequent in the Anura, especially on
  the rudiment of the thumb, and on the under surface of the joints of the fingers and toes. In many
  Anura, less frequently in the Urodela, the tips of the fingers and toes are encased in thicker
  horny sheaths, producing claws or nails. They are best developed among newts in
  <i>Onychodactylus</i>, among the Anura in <i>Xenopus</i> and <i>Hymenochirus</i>. The horny
  covering of the metatarsal tubercles reaches its greatest size in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page33"><span class="smaller">{33}</span></span>the digging spur or spade of <i>Pelobates</i>.
  In most of these cases the cutis is elevated into more or less wart-like papillae, covered, of
  course, by the proliferated and cornified epidermis. In the female of <i>Rana temporaria</i>
  nearly the whole surface of the body becomes covered with rosy papillae during the breeding
  season. Similar nuptial excrescences are common, and are most noteworthy in the male of the Indian
  <i>Rana liebigi</i>.</p>

  <p>The epidermis also contains sense-organs. They attain their highest development in the larvae;
  later on they undergo a retrogressive change. Each of these sense-organs is a little cup-shaped
  papilla, visible to the naked eye. It is composed of elongated cells which form a mantle around
  some central cells, each of which ends in a stiff cilium perforating a thin, hyaline membrane
  which lines the bottom of the cup, and is perhaps the representation of the cuticula. These
  ciliated cells are connected with sensory fibres, the nerve entering at the bottom of the whole
  organ. The cilia are in direct contact with the water, but the outer rim of the whole apparatus is
  protected by a short tube of hyaline cuticula-like secretion. These sense-organs are, in the
  larvae, scattered over the head, especially near the mouth and around the eyes, whence they extend
  backwards on to the tail, mostly in three pairs of longitudinal rows, one near the vertebral
  column, the others lateral. They are supplied by the lateral branch of the vagus nerve. They
  disappear during the metamorphosis, at least in the Anura, with the exception of <i>Xenopus</i>,
  in which they form conspicuous white objects. The white colour is caused by the tubes becoming
  choked with the d&eacute;bris of cells or coagulating mucous matter, so that it is doubtful if these
  organs, which moreover have sunk deeper into the skin, are still functional. In the terrestrial
  Urodela these organs undergo a periodical process of retrogression and rejuvenescence. During the
  life on land they shrink and withdraw from the surface, and their nerves likewise diminish, but in
  the breeding season, when the newts take again to aquatic life, they revive, are rebuilt and
  become prominent on the surface. They are an inheritance from the fishes, in which such lateral
  line organs are universally present.</p>

  <p>The cutis of most Amphibia is very rich in lymph-spaces, which, especially in the Anura, assume
  enormous proportions, since the so-called subcutaneous connective tissue forms <span
  class="pagenum" id="page34"><span class="smaller">{34}</span></span>comparatively few vertical
  septa by which the upper and denser layers, the corium proper, are connected with the underlying
  muscles. The spaces are filled with lymph, and into some of them the abnormally expanded vocal
  sacs extend, notably in <i>Paludicola</i>, <i>Leptodactylus</i>, and other Cystignathidae, and in
  <i>Rhinoderma</i>.</p>

  <p>The cutis frequently forms papillae and prominent folds, sometimes regular longitudinal keels
  on the sides of the back; but dermal, more or less calcified or ossified scales are restricted to
  the Stegocephali and to the Apoda, <i>q.v.</i>, <span class="wnw">pp. <a
  href="#page79">79</a></span>, <a href="#page87">87</a>. We conclude that the Urodela and Anura
  have entirely lost these organs. Dermal ossifications, besides those which now form an integral
  part of the skeleton, like many of the cranial membrane-bones, are rare, and are restricted to the
  Anura. They are least infrequent on the head, where the skin is more or less involved in the
  ossification of the underlying membrane-bones, for instance in <i>Triprion</i>,
  <i>Calyptocephalus</i>, <i>Hemiphractus</i> and <i>Pelobates</i>. The thick ossifications in the
  skin of the back of several species of <i>Ceratophrys</i> are very exceptional. In
  <i>Brachycephalus ephippium</i> these dermal bones enter into connection with the vertebrae; small
  plates fuse with the dorsal processes of the first to third vertebrae, while one large and thick
  plate fuses with the rest of the dorsal vertebrae. Simple calcareous deposits in the cutis are
  less uncommon, for instance, in old specimens of <i>Bufo vulgaris</i>. We are scarcely justified
  in looking upon these various calcifications and even ossifications as reminiscences of
  Stegocephalous conditions.</p>

  <p>The skin contains <b>pigment</b>. This is either diffuse or granular. Diffuse pigment, mostly
  dark brown or yellow, occurs frequently in the epidermis, even in the stratum corneum. The
  granular pigment is stored up in cells, the chromatophores, which send out am&#x0153;boid
  processes, and are restricted to the cutis, mostly to its upper stratum, where they make their
  first appearance. Contraction of the chromatophores withdraws the pigment from the surface,
  expansion distributes it more or less equally. The usual colours of the pigment are black, brown,
  yellow, and red. Green and blue are merely subjective colours, due to interference. A peculiar
  kind of colouring matter is the white pigment, which probably consists of guanine, and is likewise
  deposited within cells; cf. the description of the white spots in the skin of <i>Hyla
  coerulea</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page35"><span class="smaller">{35}</span></span></div>

  <p>Most Amphibia are capable of changing colour, the Urodela, however, far less than the Anura,
  some of which exhibit an extraordinary range and adaptability in their changes.</p>

  <p>The mechanism by which the change of colour is produced in frogs has been recently studied by
  Biedermann.<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> If we examine the green skin of the
  common Tree-frog, <i>Hyla arborea</i>, under a low power and direct light, we see a mosaic of
  green, polygonal areas, separated by dark lines and interrupted by the openings of the
  skin-glands. Seen from below the skin appears black. Under a stronger power the black layer is
  seen to be composed of anastomosing and ramified black pigment-cells. Where the light shines
  through, the skin appears yellow. The epidermis itself is quite colourless. The mosaic layer is
  composed of polygonal interference-cells, each of which consists of a basal half which is granular
  and colourless, while the upper half is made up of yellow drops. Sometimes the tree-frog appears
  blackish, and if then the black pigment-cells are induced to contract, for instance, by warming
  the frog, it appears silver-grey; in this case the pigment in the yellow drops is no longer
  diffuse, but is concentrated into a round lump lodged between the interstices of the granular
  portions; the black pigment-cells are likewise balled together. These black chromatophores send
  out numerous fine branches, which occasionally stretch between and round the polygonal cells. When
  each of these is quite surrounded and covered by the black processes, the frog appears black. On
  the other hand, when the black pigment-cells withdraw their processes, shrink up, and, so to
  speak, retire, then the light which passes through the yellow drops is, by interference, broken
  into green.</p>

  <p>Stoppage of the circulation of the blood in the skin causes the black chromatophores to
  contract. Carbon dioxide paralyses them and causes them to dilate. This is direct influence
  without the action of nerves. But stimulation of the central nerve-centres makes the skin turn
  pale. Low temperature causes expansion, high temperature contraction, of the chromatophores. Hence
  hibernating frogs are much darker than they are in the summer. Frogs kept in dry moss, or such as
  have escaped into the room and dry up, turn pale, regardless of light or darkness, probably owing
  to a central, reflex, nerve-stimulus.</p>

  <p>Tree-frogs turn green as the result of the contact with leaves. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page36"><span class="smaller">{36}</span></span>Dark frogs will turn green when put into an
  absolutely dark vessel in which there are leaves. This is reflex action, and blinded specimens do
  the same. The principal centres of the nerves which control the chromatophores, lie in the corpora
  bigemina and in the optic thalami of the brain. When these centres are destroyed, the frog no
  longer changes colour when put upon leaves, but if a nerve, for instance the sciatic, be
  stimulated, the corresponding portion of the body, in this case the leg, turns green. Rough
  surfaces cause a sensation which makes the frog turn dark. <i>Rana</i> seems to depend chiefly
  upon temperature and the amount of moisture in the air, so far as its changes of colour are
  concerned. Biedermann concludes that the "chromatic function of frogs in general depends chiefly
  upon the sensory impressions received by the skin, while that of fishes depends upon the eye."</p>

  <p>All this sounds very well, but the observations and experiments are such as are usual in
  physiological laboratories, and the frogs, when observed in their native haunts, or even when kept
  under proper conditions, do not always behave as the physiologist thinks they should. There is no
  doubt that in many cases the changes of colour are not voluntary, but reflex actions. It is quite
  conceivable that the sensation of sitting on a rough surface starts a whole train of processes:
  roughness means bark, bark is brown, change into brown; but one and the same tree-frog does not
  always assume the colour of the bark when it rests, or even sleeps upon, such a piece. He will, if
  it suits him, remain grass-green upon a yellow stone, or on a white window-frame. I purposely
  describe such conditions, changes, coincidences, and discrepancies in various species, notably in
  <i>Hyla arborea</i>, <i>H. coerulea</i>, <i>Rana temporaria</i>, <i>Bufo viridis</i>, to show that
  in many cases the creature knows what it is about, and that the eye plays a very important part in
  the decision of what colour is to be produced. The sensory impression received through the skin of
  the belly is the same, no matter if the board be painted white, black, or green, and how does it
  then come to pass that the frog adjusts its colour to a nicety to the general hue or tone of its
  surroundings?</p>

  <p>Boulenger<a id="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> has given us a summary of the action
  of the <b>poison</b> of Amphibia:</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page37"><span class="smaller">{37}</span></span></div>

  <p>It is well known to all who have handled freshly-caught newts, and certain toads, especially
  <i>Bombinator</i>, that their secretion acts as a sternutatory, and causes irritation of the nose
  and eyes, the effects produced on us by <i>Bombinator</i> being comparable to the early stages of
  a cold in the head. Many collectors of Batrachians have learned, to their discomfiture, how the
  introduction of examples of certain species into the bag containing the sport of their excursion
  may cause the death of the other prisoners; for although the poison has no effect on the skin of
  individuals of the same species, different species, however closely allied, may poison each other
  by mere contact. But when inoculated the poison acts even on the same individual.</p>

  <p>Miss Ormerod, to personally test the effect, pressed part of the back and tail of a live
  Crested Newt between the teeth. "The first effect was a bitter astringent feeling in the mouth,
  with irritation of the upper part of the throat, numbing of the teeth more immediately holding the
  animal, and in about a minute from the first touch of the newt a strong flow of saliva. This was
  accompanied by much foam and violent spasmodic action, approaching convulsions, but entirely
  confined to the mouth itself. The experiment was immediately followed by headache lasting for some
  hours, general discomfort of the system, and half an hour after by slight shivering fits."</p>

  <p>Numerous experiments have shown that the poison of toads, salamanders, and newts is capable,
  when injected, of killing mammals, birds, reptiles, and even fishes, provided, of course, that the
  dose be proportionate to the size of the animal. Small birds and lizards succumb as a rule in a
  few minutes; guinea-pigs, rabbits, and dogs in less than an hour.</p>

  <p>This poison of Amphibia is not septic, but acts upon the heart and the central nervous system.
  That of the common toad has been compared, in its effects, to that of <i>Digitalis</i> and
  <i>Erythrophlaeum</i>. Some authorities hold that the poison is an acid, others regard it as an
  alkaloid.</p>

  <p>Phisalix<a id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> has come to the conclusion that toads
  and salamanders are possessed of two kinds of glands, different both anatomically and
  physiologically. These are, first the mucous glands, spread over the greater part of the body,
  with an alkaloid secretion, which acts as a narcotic; secondly, specific glands, as <span
  class="pagenum" id="page38"><span class="smaller">{38}</span></span>the parotoids and larger
  dorsal glands, the secretion of which is acid, and acts as a convulsive.</p>

  <p>The Indians of Colombia are said to employ the secretion of <i>Dendrobates tinctorius</i> for
  poisoning their arrows. The poison is obtained by exposing the frog to a fire, and after being
  scraped off the back is sufficient for poisoning fifty arrows. It acts on the central nervous
  system, and is used especially for shooting monkeys. Concerning the use of this poison for
  "dyeing" parrots, see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page272">272</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The milky secretion of toads protects them against many enemies, although not
  always against the grass-snake. A dog which has once been induced to bite a toad, suffers so
  severely that it will not easily repeat the experiment. The handling of tree-frogs also irritates
  both nose and eyes. The hind limbs of the Water-frog, <i>Rana esculenta</i>, have a very bitter,
  acrid taste. In short, most, if not all, Amphibia are more or less poisonous, and it is
  significant that many of the most poisonous, e.g. <i>Salamandra maculosa</i>, <i>Bombinator</i>,
  <i>Dendrobates</i>, exhibit that very conspicuous combination of yellow or orange upon a dark
  ground, which is so widespread a sign of poison. Other instances of such warning colours,
  protective in a defensive sense, are the Wasps and <i>Heloderma</i>, the only poisonous
  lizard.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Nerves</span></p>

  <p><b>Spinal nerves.</b>&ndash;Each spinal nerve issues originally immediately behind the neural
  arch of the vertebral segment to which it belongs. This intra-vertebral position is ultimately
  modified into a more inter-vertebral one, owing to the predominant share of the neural arches,
  basidorsalia, in the composition of the whole vertebra. Consequently the nerves issue behind their
  corresponding vertebra.</p>

  <p>The first spinal nerve, or N. suboccipitalis, is exceptional in several respects. It develops a
  dorsal and a ventral root like a typical spinal nerve, but the dorsal root soon degenerates in all
  Amphibia, while in the Phaneroglossal Anura the whole nerve disappears. The first spinal nerve
  reduced to its ventral half persists therefore only in the Apoda, Urodela, and the Aglossal Anura.
  It issues originally between the occiput and the atlas, but in the adult it is partly imbedded in
  the anterior portion of the atlas. Its own vertebra is lost, having probably been added to the
  cranium.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page39"><span class="smaller">{39}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the Urodela the first spinal nerve either remains separate, or it joins the second spinal,
  forming with it and with a branch from the third nerve the cervical plexus, which supplies the
  muscles of the cervical region. The third, fourth, and fifth nerves, and sometimes also the sixth,
  form the brachial plexus.</p>

  <p>In the Aglossal Anura N. spinalis I. mostly sends a fine thread to the second spinal nerve, the
  rest supplies chiefly the M. levator scapulae, in <i>Pipa</i> the abdominal muscles also. In all
  the other Anura this N. spinalis I. is lost; occasional vestiges have been reported in <i>Bufo
  vulgaris</i> and <i>Rana catesbiana</i>, and remnants of it may possibly be found in Pelobatidae
  and Discoglossidae. The first actually persisting nerve of the Phaneroglossa is consequently N.
  spinalis II.</p>

  <p>The brachial plexus is composed as follows:&ndash;<i>Pipa</i>, N. spinalis II. and III.;
  <i>Xenopus</i> and Phaneroglossa, N. spinalis III. and IV., with a small branch from the second;
  the next following three nerves, numbers V., VI., and VII., behave like ordinary trunk nerves.</p>

  <p>The pelvic plexus of the Phaneroglossa is formed in <i>Rana</i> by the VIII. + IX. + X. + XIth
  nerves, the tenth issuing between the sacral vertebra and the coccyx. In <i>Bufo</i> and
  <i>Hyla</i> the plexus is composed of five nerves, the seventh spinal sending a branch to it.
  Occasionally the twelfth nerve contributes a small branch to the posterior portion of the plexus.
  This and the eleventh nerve leave the coccyx by separate holes, thereby indicating its
  composition. The rest of the spinal cord gives off no more recognisable nerves, owing to its
  reduction during the later stages of metamorphosis; its terminal filament passes out of the
  posterior end of the coccygeal canal.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Concerning the <b>cranial nerves</b> it is necessary to draw attention to one point
  only. The last nerve which leaves the cranium of the Amphibia is the vagus or tenth cranial nerve.
  There is consequently no eleventh, and no twelfth or hypoglossal, pair of cranial nerves. Their
  homologues would be the first and second spinal nerves, but the whole tongue of the Amphibia, with
  its muscles, is supplied by the glossopharyngeal, or ninth cranial pair, and is morphologically
  not homologous with the tongue of the Amniota.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page40"><span class="smaller">{40}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Respiratory Organs</span></p>

  <p>A very important and characteristic feature of the Amphibia is the development of two sets of
  respiratory organs: Gills and Lungs. It is as well to give definitions of these organs.
  <i>Lungs</i> are hollow evaginations from the ventral wall of the pharynx, and their thin,
  vascularised walls enable the blood to exchange, by osmosis, carbon dioxide for oxygen from the
  air which enters the lungs by the mouth or the nostrils, and the windpipe. The latter is unpaired,
  the lungs themselves are paired. <i>Gills</i> are highly vascularised, more or less ramified
  excrescences, covered by a thin epithelium of ecto- or endo-dermal origin, which permits of the
  exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen from the air which is suspended in the surrounding water. It
  is obvious that this definition applies to all sorts of well-vascularised organs whose thin
  surface comes into contact with the water. Various recesses of the pharyngeal cavity, the dorsal
  and ventral folds of the tail-fin, nay, even any part of the skin of the body can, and does
  occasionally, assume additional respiratory functions. The proper definition of gills, in
  Vertebrates, requires, therefore, the restriction that they must be developed upon and carried by
  visceral arches.</p>

  <p>The general statement that the Amphibia breathe by lungs, and, at least during some stage of
  their life, also by gills, requires various restrictions. As a rule the majority of Amphibia first
  develop gills, later on also lungs, whereupon, during the metamorphosis, the gills are gradually
  suppressed, so that the perfect animal breathes by lungs only (see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page61">61</a></span>). But a number of Urodela retain their gills throughout life,
  although the lungs are also functional. These are the Perennibranchiata, not a natural group, but
  a heterogenous assembly, Proteidae and Sirenidae. Some species of <i>Amblystoma</i> remain
  individually Perennibranchiate (cf. Axolotl, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page112">112</a></span>). On the other hand, in some Anura the gills are almost or entirely
  suppressed, or restricted to the embryonic period only. Lastly, a considerable number of
  Salamandridae have lost their lungs; they breathe by gills until their metamorphosis, but have in
  the adult state to resort to respiration by the skin (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page46">46</a></span>).</p>

  <p>The general plan of the development of the branchial respiratory apparatus is as
  follows:&ndash;The six visceral arches, <span class="pagenum" id="page41"><span
  class="smaller">{41}</span></span>namely, the mandibular, the hyoidean, and the four branchial
  arches, correspond, long before they are cartilaginous, with four main arterial arches of the
  truncus arteriosus. The first, the arteria hyo-mandibularis, belongs to the hyoidean and
  mandibular segments, the second to the first branchial, the third to the second branchial, while
  the fourth soon splits in two for the third and fourth or last branchial arch. On the dorsal side
  these branchial arterial arches combine to form the radix of the dorsal aorta. These arches,
  especially the three branchials, appear in newts, less clearly in frogs, as transverse ridges on
  the sides of the future neck. Between the arches the pharynx gradually bulges out in the shape of
  five lateral gill-pouches; the first between the mandibular and the hyoidean arch, the second
  between the hyoidean and the first branchial arch, etc. These pouches soon break through to the
  outside and become gill-clefts, except the first pouch in Urodela. <i>Before</i> the breaking
  through of the clefts there appears upon the outside of the middle of the rim of each arch a
  little knob, which soon ramifies and forms an external gill. The knob owes its origin to the
  development of a blood-vessel which buds from the arterial arch, ramifies and breaks up into
  capillaries, and returns a little further dorsalwards into the arch. A secondary loop to the
  outside of the primary arterial arch is thus formed; and whilst this outer loop sprouts out
  further, driving before it the likewise proliferating skin, and thus producing the gill, the
  middle portion of the primary arch remains in the Urodela as a short cut, but in the Anura it
  partly obliterates, and henceforth acts as the internal <i>efferent</i> vessel of the gill. When,
  during metamorphosis, the gills disappear, their intrinsic <i>afferent</i> and <i>efferent</i>
  vessels vanish likewise, and the short cut completes the circuit. In order to do this they have,
  in the Anura, to form new connections with the trunks of the afferent vessels.</p>

  <p>The arterial arches themselves are modified as follows:&ndash;The first pair become the
  carotids, the second form the right and left aortic arches, while the third and fourth unite and
  are transformed into the pulmonary arteries and "ductus Botalli," the last arterial arch having
  previously sent a branch into the developing lungs. In the Anura the third arch obliterates.</p>

  <p>The gills and clefts present various modifications. The Urodela possess three pairs of gills,
  one each upon the dorsal <span class="pagenum" id="page42"><span
  class="smaller">{42}</span></span>half of the three branchial arches, just near the upper corners
  of the clefts; and the skin of the body is continued upon the stem of each gill, pigmented like
  the rest of the surface of the body. Such a gill is more or less like a blade, standing
  vertically, and is composed of a stem of connective tissue, thick at the base, and, as a rule,
  carrying two series of fine lamellae, which, however, do not form two opposite series, but hang
  downwards, being, so to speak, folded down, so that the upper surface of the stem is bare, and
  carries the lamellae on its under side. In the Axolotl some of these lamellae are further
  subdivided. In <i>Necturus</i> they are enormously increased in numbers, but are rather short, and
  they stand no longer in two rows, but are crowded into one. Those of <i>Proteus</i> form two rows
  of dendritic filaments; those of <i>Siren</i> are likewise much ramified.</p>

  <p>The larvae of the Urodela have four clefts. In the adult <i>Siren</i> these are reduced to
  three, the first, namely, that between the hyoid and the first branchial arch, being closed up. In
  <i>Necturus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, and <i>Typhlomolge</i> the clefts are further reduced to two,
  owing to the closing up of the first and last, only those between the first, second, and third
  arches remaining. <i>Amphiuma</i>, and usually <i>Cryptobranchus alleghaniensis</i>, possess only
  one pair of clefts, while in <i>C. japonicus</i> and in the Salamandridae all the clefts are
  abolished.</p>

  <p>The gills of the Urodela are always uncovered, although a short operculum is formed from the
  posterior margin of the hyoidean arch; the halves of this fold meet below the throat, and persist
  in various terrestrial and aquatic species as the "gular fold." It reaches its greatest size just
  before metamorphosis, but scarcely ever produces a proper outer gill-chamber, and it does not
  cover the gills owing to their rather pronounced dorsal position. It is perhaps best developed in
  <i>Typhlomolge</i>, and even there its dorsal portion is continued upon the first of the three
  broad vertical and short-fringed blades which form the gills.</p>

  <p>A description of the gills of the Apoda will be found in the systematic part.</p>

  <p>In the Anura the gills are complicated, owing to the development of the so-called internal
  gills. First appear, exactly in the same way as in the Urodela, the external gills, one upon each
  of the first three branchial arches. In the larva of <i>Rana esculenta</i>, 5 mm. in length, a
  little protuberance appears upon the first, <span class="pagenum" id="page43"><span
  class="smaller">{43}</span></span>and then upon the second arch. In the 6 mm. larva the first gill
  shows four knobs, the second two, the third one knob. They are always delicate and thin, although
  sometimes pigmented, long, and much-ramified structures. The first pair is always the largest;
  well developed and persisting a long time in <i>Rana temporaria</i>; smaller in <i>R.
  esculenta</i> and <i>Bufo vulgaris</i>; very short, scarcely forked, in <i>B. viridis</i> and
  <i>Hyla arborea</i>. They are relatively largest in <i>Alytes</i>, while still in the egg.
  Numerous descriptions of these gills will be found in the systematic part.</p>

  <p>Great changes take place about the time when the fourth or last branchial arch and the
  pulmonary arteries are developed. This occurs in <i>R. esculenta</i> when the larva is about 9 mm.
  long. The sprouting of the gills extends gradually downwards along the arches upon their ventral
  halves, and these new gill-filaments or loops transform themselves into numerous dendritic
  bundles, resting in several thickset rows upon the hinder margin of the first to the third arch,
  one row only on the fourth arch, which carries no external gill. These "internal gills" look like
  red bolsters or thick and short-tasselled bunches. Whilst they are developing the dorsal, older
  gills become arrested in their growth and disappear, and at the same time a right and left
  opercular fold grows out from the head and covers these new gills, shutting them up in an outer
  branchial chamber, just like that of Teleostei and other Tectobranch fishes. This is the reason
  why these new gills have been called internal, and the mistaken notion has sprung up that they are
  comparable with the true internal gills of fishes. In reality Amphibia have only external gills.
  They are always covered by ectoderm, are restricted to the outside of the branchial arches, and
  are developed before the formation of the clefts. These gills are in many cases directly
  continuous with the more dorsally and more superficially placed earlier external gills; but
  although nearly every one who has studied their development has observed this agreement, the old
  error still prevails. They are morphologically as little internal as the true internal gills of
  Elasmobranch embryos are external gills, because these have become so elongated that they protrude
  out of the gill-clefts.</p>

  <p>The fact that the Amphibia possess only external gills throws important light upon their
  phylogeny. Not only do the Apoda, Urodela, and Anura agree much more with each other than <span
  class="pagenum" id="page44"><span class="smaller">{44}</span></span>would be the case if the Anura
  possessed both internal and external gills, but the Amphibia reveal themselves also in this point
  as connected with the Crossopterygii and the Dipnoi, some of which fishes also possess external
  gills. It is of course quite possible that the Amphibia have developed these organs independently,
  but we understand now that the latter are accessory, and not the primitive respiratory organs;
  they are developed in adaptation to embryonic conditions and to prolonged larval, occasionally
  perennibranchiate, aquatic life (cf. the chapter on Neoteny, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page63">63</a></span>).</p>

  <p>There is no valid reason for supposing that the Stegocephali had true internal gills. We know
  their branchial skeleton, and we can discern even gill-rakers on the arches. Such gill-rakers
  occur also, although but feebly developed, in Urodela. The whole branchial framework of the
  Urodela and Apoda undergoes simple reductions during metamorphosis (see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page86">86</a></span>), but in the Anura these arches are in early tadpole life transformed
  into a most complicated basket-work which acts as a straining apparatus or filter, to prevent any
  particle of food or other foreign matter from finding its way into the delicate gills, the current
  of water passing from the mouth through the filter, past the gills and out of the clefts. During
  metamorphosis this whole elaborate apparatus is again transformed, almost beyond recognition, into
  the hyoidean apparatus for the support of the generally very movable and much-specialised tongue.
  The fact that the hyoid apparatus of the Aglossa, especially that of <i>Xenopus</i>, is
  constructed upon the same lines, is a strong indication that these creatures have arrived at their
  tongueless condition through the loss of this organ, and this is intelligible in correlation with
  their absolutely aquatic life.</p>

  <p>The opercular folds assume great dimensions in all tadpoles. They cover the whole gill-region,
  thereby producing on either side an outer gill-chamber. The posterior margins of the folds
  gradually become continuous with the rest of the surface of the body. Each gill-chamber opens at
  first by one lateral canal, usually called the spiracle. This condition prevails in the tadpoles
  of the Aglossa. In the Discoglossidae the two canals gradually converge and combine into one
  median opening on the middle of the belly. In all the other Anura the right opening becomes
  closed, or rather its canal passes over to and joins that of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45"><span class="smaller">{45}</span></span>left side, both opening by one short tube
  laterally on the left side, at a variable distance between the eye and the vent. Hence the elegant
  terms of Amphi-, Medio-, and Laevo-gyrinidae (<span title="gyrinos"
  class="fsn">&gamma;&upsilon;&rho;&#x1FD6;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> being the Greek for
  tadpole).</p>

  <p>The external gills lead to a further consideration. <i>Protopterus</i> possesses a vestigial
  external gill on the shoulder-girdle. <i>Lepidosiren</i> has them on the gill-arches, resembling
  piscine internal gills, and <i>Polypterus</i> has a large biserially fringed external gill (in
  some cases not disappearing until the fish is adult), which starts from the mandibular arch, at
  the level of the spiracle or first visceral cleft, and overlaps the operculum externally. The axis
  of this peculiar organ is possibly based upon the homologues of the spiracular cartilages, which
  themselves are the branchiostegal rays of the dorsal half of the quadrato-mandibular arch. The
  branchiostegal rays of the hyoidean arch, at least their material, have given rise to the
  elaborate opercular apparatus; and, in conformity herewith, the hyomandibular itself is not known
  to carry a gill. Quite possibly the large external gill of <i>Polypterus</i> is not serially
  homologous with other external gills&ndash;it may not be a true gill at all, it has perhaps quite
  a different function&ndash;but it seems to throw light upon a mysterious pair of organs which are
  common in larval and young Urodela, in the larval Aglossa and in the Apoda. These are the
  "balancers."</p>

  <p>In <i>Triton taeniatus</i>, before hatching, there appears a little protuberance behind and
  below the eye; it rests upon the angle of the mandibular arch, and is separated from the first
  transverse, externally visible ridge of the first branchial arch by the beginnings of the hyoidean
  arch. A few days later the arteria hyomandibularis sends a vessel into this knob, forms a vascular
  coil, and leaves it as a vein which, instead of returning into the arterial arch, passes into the
  veins of the body. Its epithelium is not covered with flat, but with cubical cells; and sensory
  cells have not been found in it. These organs attain some size, and are shaped like rods, with
  thickened ends; they are movable, and are used by the larvae as "balancers," keeping the head from
  sinking into the slime at the bottom. But they may have other functions besides, and it is not
  unlikely that they develop into sensory organs like feelers. They occur in many Salamandridae, and
  are not reduced until, or even after, the metamorphosis, and during this time they shift their
  place with relation to the eye and the mouth.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page46"><span class="smaller">{46}</span></span></div>

  <p>The same kind of organs occur in <i>Amblystoma</i>.<a id="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> They appear, previous to the breaking open of the gill-clefts,
  as protrusions of epiblast, long before any of the external gills on the branchial arches. When
  the clefts have broken open, the quadrate sends out laterally a tiny crescent-shaped process a
  little above the jaw-joint, and this process extends to the base of the balancer, but not into it,
  and a bundle of muscle-cells grows into the balancer. It is easy to recognise the same organ in
  the extremely long thread-like structures of the larva of <i>Xenopus</i>. In the Apoda they are
  likewise present, but are retained permanently as highly specialised, probably tentacular organs
  (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page86">86</a></span>, Apoda).</p>

  <p>One of the most unexpected features is the <b>suppression of the lungs</b> in various kinds of
  Salamandridae. The lungs are either reduced to useless vestiges or they are quite absent. This
  occurs in aquatic and terrestrial, American and European forms, and it is noteworthy that the
  reduction of the lungs does not apply to all the species of the various genera, nor is it
  restricted to one sub-family.</p>

  <p>The following list is due to the researches of H. H. Wilder,<a id="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> L. Camerano,<a id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> E.
  L&ouml;nnberg,<a id="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> and G. S. Hopkins<a id="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>:&ndash;All the Desmognathinae and Plethodontinae;
  Amblystomatinae, <i>Amblystoma opacum</i>; Salamandrinae, <i>Salamandrina perspicillata</i>. In
  <i>Triton</i> and other Salamandrinae the length of the lungs varies; in some they extend more, in
  others less, than half way down the distance between head and pelvis. Hopkins remarks: "Two
  questions are naturally suggested by this apparently aberrant condition of the respiratory organs.
  First, what structures or organs have taken on the function of the lungs and branchiae; and
  secondly, is there any modification in the form or structure of the heart which in any way may be
  correlated with the above-mentioned peculiarities of the lungless forms?" Wilder concluded that
  respiration was probably carried on by the skin, and perhaps, to some extent, by the mucosa of the
  intestine. Camerano thinks that, at least in the European forms, respiration is effected by the
  bucco-pharyngeal cavity, and that the skin affords no efficient aid. The left auricle in the
  lungless forms is much <span class="pagenum" id="page47"><span
  class="smaller">{47}</span></span>smaller in comparison than the right, and there is no pulmonary
  vein. The auricular septum has a large aperture, the communication between the auricles being
  larger than even in <i>Necturus</i> (which breathes essentially by gills). The sinus venosus,
  instead of opening into the right auricle only, opens more freely into the left than into the
  right, and the latter communicates more directly with the ventricle than the left, instead of
  about equally. In short, the heart of these creatures appears almost bilocular, instead of being
  trilocular, at least functionally.</p>

  <p>The lungs of the Urodela are always simple, extremely thin-walled bags. They are highly
  developed in the Anura, the walls being modified into numerous air-cells, whereby the respiratory
  surface is considerably increased. The lungs are filled with air by the pumping motion of the
  throat while the mouth is closed, the nostrils being provided with muscular valves. A muscular
  apparatus assists the filling of the lungs in the Anura.<a id="NtA_23"

  <p class="sp3">Most, if not all, Anura and some Urodela have a <b>voice</b> produced by the
  larynx, which, especially in the Anura, is provided with a complicated cartilaginous and muscular
  apparatus and with vocal cords. The voice of the Urodela is at the best a feeble squeak. The
  females of the Anura are either mute or they produce a mere grunt, but that of many males is very
  loud, and, moreover, in many species it is intensified by <i>vocal sacs</i> which act as
  resonators. These sacs are diverticula of the lining of the mouth-cavity, and bulge out the outer
  skin and the muscles, chiefly the mylo-hyoid, of the throat. The nostrils and the mouth are firmly
  closed during the croaking. "The sacs are called internal when they are covered by the unmodified
  gular integument, however much this may be distended; external when their membrane projects
  through slits at <span class="pagenum" id="page48"><span class="smaller">{48}</span></span>the

  pouch, as in <i>Hyla arborea</i>."<a id="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> These sacs
  exhibit many modifications. They may be unpaired and median, and open by two slits into the mouth,
  on either side below the tongue; in <i>Bufo</i> one of the slits or openings, either the right or
  the left, is obliterated. They may be paired and symmetrical, and open one on each side of the
  head, below and near the posterior angle of the jaws. These modifications differ in closely allied
  species. They reach their greatest complication in <i>Rhinoderma</i> and in some of the
  Cystignathidae by extending far back beneath the skin into the wide lymphatic spaces. In
  <i>Rhinoderma</i> they are put to the unique use of nurseries for the young (see <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page228">228</a></span>). <i>Leptodactylus typhonius</i> has a very
  distinct pair of outer vocal sacs and a well-marked unpaired sac which extends into the belly and
  communicates with each outer sac. Several species of <i>Paludicola</i>, e.g. <i>P.
  fuscomaculata</i> and <i>P. signifera</i>, have a similar arrangement, in addition to an unpaired
  gular sac which can be inflated independently of the rest (see Fig. 45, <span class="wnw">p. <a

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Urino-Genital Organs</span></p>

  <p>The kidneys and the male generative glands are still intimately connected with each other. The
  general plan is as follows:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The kidneys consist of a large number of glomeruli, produced by the coiled segmental tubes,
  each of which is composed of a nephrostome or funnel opening into the body-cavity, a Malpighian
  body and an efferent canal. The latter combine to form the segmental duct which opens into the
  cloaca. The testes, composed of a large number of sperm-producing glands, are drained by
  transverse canals which combine into a longitudinal canal, and this again sends off numerous
  efferent canals which open into the efferent canals of the kidney, so that the segmental duct
  (Leydig's duct of many authors) conveys both sperma and urine.</p>

  <p>In the female the network of transverse and longitudinal canals, which originally connect the
  generative glands with the kidney's efferent canals, is deduced in so far as the connection is
  interrupted and the vestiges of the transverse canals are no longer functional. The eggs fall into
  the body-cavity and are caught up by the ostium or inner abdominal opening of a special duct, the
  oviduct (M&uuml;llerian duct of many authors). Vestiges, more or less complete, of these oviducts
  persist in the males of most Amphibia.</p>

  <p>This general scheme presents some modifications in the various groups of Amphibia.</p>

  <p>The Apoda retain the most primitive conditions. The kidneys are still long and narrow, and the
  glomeruli are, at least in the anterior part of the organ, still strictly segmental, agreeing in
  number and position, each with a vertebral segment; later, the number of the glomeruli is greatly
  increased, and the former agreement becomes quite disturbed. The generative glands still retain
  their segmental arrangement, but they are restricted to a much shorter region than the kidneys. In
  the male Apoda a considerable portion of the cloaca can be everted by special muscles, and acts as
  an intromittent organ. Both sexes possess a ventral urinary bladder.</p>

  <p>In the Urodela both kidneys and testes are much concentrated, the testes especially have lost
  all outward appearance of segmentation, and their efferent canals, connecting them with the
  longitudinal collecting canal, are much reduced in numbers. The greater portion of the kidneys, at
  least their anterior half, has all the appearance of a degenerating organ and is on the way to
  losing its urinary function, although it still possesses Malpighian bodies and complete ducts; the
  main function of the latter is now the conveyance of the sperma. In the Perennibranchiata, and in
  some others, e.g. <i>Spelerpes variegatus</i>, the longitudinal collecting canal, between testis
  and kidney, is sometimes suppressed, a very simple, but pseudo-primitive arrangement. A urinary
  bladder is present. The cloaca is not eversible.</p>

  <p>In most Anura, e.g. <i>Rana</i> and <i>Bufo</i> (Fig. 7; <span class="smaller">4</span>, <span
  class="smaller">5</span>), the same scheme is adhered to. The efferent canals of the testis form a
  network, with a longitudinal canal, and open into the efferent canals of the kidney, in the
  substance of which they are more or less deeply imbedded. The ducts which lead out of the kidney
  to compose Leydig's duct, are frequently dilated, or the latter duct is much elongated, convoluted
  or varicated, and this whole portion is enclosed in a sheath of connective tissue, giving an <span
  class="pagenum" id="page51"><span class="smaller">{51}</span></span>appearance as if the single
  duct itself were dilated in the greater part of its length; hence the occasional name of vesicula
  seminalis. Such means of storing the sperma enable the latter to be ejected suddenly in great
  quantities.</p>

  <p>In <i>Bombinator</i> (<span class="smaller">6</span>) some of the most anterior seminal canals
  do not perforate the kidney, but run over it superficially and open directly into a branch of
  Leydig's duct. This branch, no doubt equivalent to a number of segmental canals which have lost
  their uriniferous function, is curved round the upper end of the permanent kidney, while its
  forward continuation, ending blindly, is the remnant of its former headward extension. This
  arrangement of <i>Bombinator</i> is carried further in <i>Discoglossus</i> (<span
  class="smaller">7</span>). The testis conveys its sperma through a wide duct directly into
  Leydig's canal, without interfering with the kidney, and all the testicular efferent network is
  lost. The anterior end of Leydig's duct still extends headwards; its middle portion acts solely as
  a vas deferens, while the lower portion still behaves like a typical segmental duct, conveying
  both sperma and urine. Lastly, in <i>Alytes</i> (<span class="smaller">8</span>) the functional
  division of the old segmental duct has been carried to an extreme. The kidney is drained by one
  canal only, now a true ureter, and this is of course produced by a consolidation of the multiple
  exclusively uriniferous canals of the lower half of the kidney. The whole of the segmental duct is
  now in the service of the testis, and near its junction with the ureter it forms a large
  diverticulum or true vesicula seminalis.</p>

  <p>Remnants of oviducts, or M&uuml;llerian ducts, are common in the male Anura; they are best developed
  in <i>Bufo</i>, much reduced, and individually absent, in <i>Rana</i>. In <i>Bombinator</i> each
  duct is restricted to its upper or abdominal portion, and is attached to the vestigial headward
  extension of Leydig's duct. Lastly in <i>Discoglossus</i> and in <i>Alytes</i> all traces of
  oviducts seem to have vanished, at least in the adult males.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that in the arrangement of the urino-genital ducts the Discoglossidae
  are the most advanced of all Amphibia, instead of showing the most primitive conditions. This is
  rather unexpected, but is paralleled by the epichordal type of the vertebral column.</p>

  <p>The oviducts of the Apoda and Urodela remain more or less straight; in the viviparous species
  they form uterus-like dilatations. In the Anura they become greatly elongated during the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page52"><span class="smaller">{52}</span></span>breeding season and form many
  convolutions. As a rule each oviduct opens separately into the cloaca, but in <i>Hyla</i> they
  have one unpaired opening, while in <i>Bufo</i> and <i>Alytes</i> the lower parts of both oviducts
  are themselves confluent.</p>

  <p>All Amphibia possess <b>Fat-bodies</b>. They consist of richly vascularised lymphatic tissue,
  the meshes of which are filled with lymph-cells, globules of fat and oil. In the Apoda these
  bodies lie laterally to the generative glands, and along the posterior half of the kidneys. In the
  Urodela they accompany the anterior half of the kidney. In the Anura they are lobate, and are
  placed upon the anterior end of the testes or ovaries. Their exact function is still doubtful, but
  it is intimately connected with that of the generative glands. The old notion, that they are
  simply stores of fat for the nourishment of the animal during hibernation, is quite untenable. The
  fat-bodies do not decrease during this period, on the contrary they attain their fullest size in
  the spring at the time of the rapidly awaking activity of the reproductive organs, and they enable
  considerable quantities of sperma and of eggs to be produced and ripened without detriment to, or
  utter exhaustion of, the animals, which often spawn before they have had time or opportunity to
  feed. After the spawning season the fat-bodies have dwindled down to inconspicuous dimensions.</p>

  <p>Lastly, there is in some Anura, hitherto observed in <i>Bufo</i> only, a mysterious organ,
  intercalated between the fat-body and the testis or ovary. This is "Bidder's organ" and it seems
  to be a rudimentary ovary, or rather that upper, anterior portion of the whole organ which
  undergoes retrogressive metamorphosis. It disappears in old female toads, but in the males it
  sometimes assumes a size equal to, or surpassing that of the testes. The males are in this respect
  hermaphrodite, and cases are known in which parts of the generative glands have developed testes
  and egg-bearing ovaries.</p>

  <p>The <b>spermatozoa</b> of the Apoda and Urodela have an undulating membrane along the tail,
  while the head-end is either pointed or truncated. Those of <i>Spelerpes fuscus</i> and of
  <i>Ichthyophis glutinosa</i> measure about 0.7 mm. in total length, those of the other Urodela
  being much smaller. A peculiarity of the Urodela is that their spermatozoa are massed together in
  or upon spermatophores, an arrangement which undoubtedly facilitates the internal <span
  class="pagenum" id="page53"><span class="smaller">{53}</span></span>fecundation of the female
  without actual copulation. The female takes up such a deposited spermatophore with the cloacal
  lips, squeezes the sperma out of the capsule which remains behind, and either conveys the former
  into a special receptaculum seminis, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Salamandra atra</i> and in <i>Triton</i>,
  or the spermatozoa wriggle their way, thanks to the undulating tail, directly up the oviducts to
  the ova.</p>

  <p>The spermatophores are composed of a colourless, soft, gelatinous mass, which is probably
  produced by the cloacal gland. The shell of jelly is in fact a cast of the cloacal cavity,
  reproducing all its ridges, furrows and folds, while a toad-stool-shaped papilla of the cloaca
  makes the inside lumen of the cast, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Triton</i>. Those of <i>Salamandra
  maculosa</i> are much simpler, consisting, in conformity with the absence of a cloacal papilla,
  merely of a cone with a globular mass of sperma on the top. Those of <i>Amblystoma</i> are
  similar.</p>

  <p>The spermatozoa of the Anura show considerable differences in the various genera, of which,
  however, only the European forms have been properly examined. The "head" is wound like a corkscrew
  in <i>Discoglossus</i>, <i>Pelobates</i>, and <i>Pelodytes</i>; spindle-shaped, more or less
  curved, in <i>Rana temporaria</i> and <i>R. agilis</i>, <i>Hyla</i>, <i>Bufo</i> and
  <i>Bombinator</i>, in the latter with an irregular membrane on one side; cylindrical in <i>Rana
  esculenta</i> and <i>R. arvalis</i>. The tail is mostly long and filiform, but in <i>Bufo
  vulgaris</i> and <i>Discoglossus</i> it is provided with an undulating membrane. Their size is
  generally very small, only about 0.1 mm., excepting those of <i>Discoglossus</i> which reach the
  astonishing length of 3 mm. These differences in shape, especially that of the head, explain why
  species of the same genus, e.g. <i>Rana temporaria</i> and <i>R. arvalis</i>, cannot fertilise
  each other.</p>

  <p>The <b>eggs</b> differ much in size, colour, and numbers. They are holoblastic, with unequal
  cleavage, but those species which possess an unusual amount of food-yolk, for instance
  <i>Rhacophorus schlegeli</i> and the Apoda, approach the meroblastic type of segmentation. As a
  rule, the greater the amount of yolk, the smaller is the number of eggs produced. But the number
  which is laid <span class="pagenum" id="page54"><span class="smaller">{54}</span></span>during one
  season is not only difficult to calculate, but it varies individually, old females laying more
  than young specimens. Moreover, some kinds, <i>e.g.</i> the Discoglossidae, spawn several times in
  one year. <i>Alytes</i>, <i>Rhinoderma</i>, <i>Hylodes</i>, <i>Rhacophorus</i>, <i>Pipa</i>, in
  fact those kinds which are remarkable for special nursing habits, lay only a few dozen eggs at a
  time. <i>Hyla arborea</i> produces up to 1000, <i>Rana temporaria</i> about 3000, <i>Bufo
  vulgaris</i> averages 5000, <i>Bufo viridis</i> and <i>Rana esculenta</i> up to 10,000 and more.
  T. H. Morgan<a id="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> has observed a <i>Bufo
  lentiginosus</i> which laid 28,000 eggs within ten hours! The number of eggs produced by the Apoda
  and Urodela is comparatively moderate, in the average a few dozen, <i>Amblystoma</i> alone laying
  about 1000.</p>

  <p>The eggs possess a gelatinous mantle of variable thickness and consistency. In <i>Amphiuma</i>
  they are strung together like the beads of a rosary, and the envelope hardens into a kind of
  shell. Many Newts and some Anura fasten their eggs singly on to plants and other objects in the
  water, with or without threads of stiffening mucus. In many Anura, <i>e.g.</i> Bufonidae, they
  pass out as closely-set strings of beads, one string out of each oviduct; in others, <i>e.g.</i>
  Ranidae, they are disconnected, and form large, lumpy masses, especially when the gelatinous
  mantle swells up in the water. The use of this mantle seems to be chiefly the protection of the
  growing embryo, which in many species, when hatched out of the egg proper, drops into and remains
  for some time in the softened jelly. Possibly the latter affords some nutriment to the early
  larva.</p>

  <p>Concerning the mode of <b>fecundation</b> it is to be remarked that copulation proper takes
  place only in the Apoda. For the Urodela Boulenger<a id="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
  has given the following summary. In no case does actual copulation take place. The male deposits
  the spermatophores which it is the office of the female to secure:&ndash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p><span class="hid">I</span>I. No amplexus, but a lengthy courtship in the water; the male is

    dermal appendages.</p>

      <div class="bq3">
        <p><i>a.</i> The male, distinguished by a greater development of the fore-limbs, which are
        armed with temporary excrescences, clasps the female in the axillary region with the
        fore-limbs: <i>Triton waltli</i>.</p>
        <p class="sp0"><i>b.</i> The male, distinguished by a greater development of the hind-limbs
        and a prehensile tail, clasps the female in the lumbar and caudal regions: The
        <i>Euproctus</i>-group of newts: <i>Triton asper</i>, <i>T. rusconii</i>, and <i>T.
        montanus</i>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The act of fecundation of most of the other kinds of Urodela, notably <i>Cryptobranchus</i>,
  <i>Amphiuma</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, has not yet been observed.</p>

  <p>Embracing of the two sexes is the universal rule with the Anura, the male creeping on to the
  back of the female and clasping her firmly with the arms and hands either in the inguinal region,
  higher up, or under the armpits. See the numerous statements in the systematic part. This often
  extremely forcible, pressing embrace seems to be necessary, although the females can deposit the
  eggs without the help of the male, but in such cases the expulsion takes place at irregular
  intervals instead of at one time. When the eggs appear at last, and this happens in many species
  many hours, or even some days, after the beginning of the embrace, the male voids the contents of
  its seminal vesicles over them. Fertilisation is consequently external, with the possible
  exception of <i>Pipa</i>, <i>q.v.</i> <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page152">152</a></span>.</p>

  <p><b>Deposition of the eggs and nursing habits.</b>&ndash;The majority of the Amphibia are
  oviparous, but some Apoda and Urodela are viviparous. It is unnecessary to call the latter
  condition ovo-viviparous, since this is really a distinction without a difference.</p>

  <p>Viviparous forms:&ndash;amongst Urodela; <i>Salamandra maculosa</i>, the young burst the
  egg-membrane in the act of being born, and are provided with long gills; <i>S. atra</i>, the young
  undergo their whole development and metamorphosis within the uterus (see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page119">119</a></span>); <i>Spelerpes fuscus</i>, the young are likewise born in the
  perfect condition: amongst Apoda; <i>Typhlonectes compressicauda</i> and <i>Dermophis
  thomensis</i>.</p>

  <p>The oviparous Apoda, at least <i>Ichthyophis</i> and <i>Hypogeophis</i>, and a few of the
  Urodela, as <i>Desmognathus</i> and <i>Amphiuma</i>, take care of their eggs by coiling themselves
  around them in a hole underground.</p>

  <p>Nursing habits are very common amongst the Anura. <span class="pagenum" id="page56"><span
  class="smaller">{56}</span></span>Boulenger<a id="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> has
  summarised the various conditions concerning the deposition and care that is taken of the eggs, in
  the following list, in which more recent discoveries have been interpolated.</p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>I. The ovum is small, and the larva leaves it in a comparatively early embryonic

        European forms, except <i>Alytes</i>.</p>
        <p class="sp0"><i>b.</i> The eggs are laid in a specially walled-in part of the pond:
        <i>Hyla faber</i>.</p>

      <p>B. The eggs are deposited out of the water:&ndash;</p>
      <div class="bq3">
        <p><i>a.</i> In holes, or under grass, near the banks of pools. The larvae are liberated and
        washed into the water by the next heavy rain: <i>Leptodactylus ocellatus</i>, <i>L.
        mystacinus</i>, <i>Paludicola gracilis</i>, <i>Pseudophryne australis</i> and <i>P.

    <p>II. The yolk is very large and the young undergoes the whole or part of the metamorphosis

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>The development and metamorphosis</b> of many species have been described in the systematic
  part. The following is a short general account of some of the more important features.
  Metamorphosis in the Apoda and Urodela is restricted chiefly to the reduction of the gills, the
  closing of the clefts, and the loss of the <span class="pagenum" id="page57"><span
  class="smaller">{57}</span></span>gill-chamber and the finny margins of the tail; but the change
  from the tadpole to the final Anurous animal implies an almost entire reorganisation.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig9.jpg"><img style="width:52%" src="images/fig9.jpg" alt="fig9" title="fig9"

    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span>&ndash;Four stages of the development of the
      adhesive apparatus (<i>A</i>) of <i>Bufo vulgaris</i>; <i>M</i>, Mouth; <i>Sp.T.</i>
      spiracular tube. In 3 the gills are almost completely hidden by the united right and left
      opercular folds. The small outlined figures indicate the shape and natural size of the
      tadpoles. (After Thiele.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the earliest condition the embryo consists of a large head and body, while the tail is still
  absent. Behind the beginnings of the future mouth appears a transverse crescentic fold, with the
  convexity looking backwards, which develops into the paired or unpaired <i>adhesive apparatus</i>.
  This consists of large complex glands, developed in the Malpighian layer, originally covered by
  the cuticula, which soon disappears, whereupon the sticky secretion enables the larva to attach
  itself to the gelatinous mantle of the egg, later on to weeds or other objects in the water. The
  name of suckers, often applied to this apparatus, conveys a wrong idea, there being neither
  muscles nor any suctorial function. The shape of this organ undergoes many changes during the
  early life of the individual, and differs much in the various genera, affording thereby diagnostic
  characters.<a id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> At first a crescent, it divides into a
  right and a left oval or disc, which either remain asunder and behind the mouth (<i>Rana</i>,
  <i>Bufo</i>), or they move forwards to the corners of the mouth (<i>Hyla</i>) or further back, and
  unite again more or less completely, as in <i>Discoglossus</i> and <i>Bombinator</i>. It is mostly
  of short duration, and disappears by the time that the larva, by the proper development of the
  gills and the tail and the functional mouth, changes into the tadpole. But in a few species these
  discs transform themselves into an elaborate ventral disc. Such an organ persists throughout the
  greater part of the tadpole-stage in certain Oriental species of <i>Rana</i>, all of which, when
  adult, possess fully webbed toes and <span class="pagenum" id="page58"><span
  class="smaller">{58}</span></span>strongly dilated discs on the fingers and toes, e.g. <i>Rana
  whiteheadi</i>, <i>R. natatrix</i>, and <i>R. cavitympanum</i> of Borneo, <i>R. jerboa</i> of Java
  (this larva was originally described and figured as that of <i>Rhacophorus reinwardti</i>), and
  <i>R. afghana</i> of the Himalayan system. These tadpoles, at least those of <i>R. jerboa</i>, are
  further remarkable for having the "spiracular" opening very far back on the left side, nearer to
  the base of the tail than to the snout, so as to be well out of the way when the creature has
  attached itself by the adhesive disc.</p>

  id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> In the young larvae of <i>Rana temporaria</i>, one
  or two days after hatching, a shallow groove appears above the conspicuous pair of adhesive
  organs. The groove becomes rhombic in outline, and when the mouth has been formed in its centre,
  the jaws appear in the median corners of the rhombus. The epidermis then rises like a circular
  wall around the jaws, and divides into an upper and lower lip; furrows appear on them, and between
  these various papillae and comb-like transverse plates of teeth. The papillae are possibly tactile
  organs, but although nerves enter them, nerve-endings of a sensory nature have not yet been
  discovered. On the fourth day the jaws become black, by the tenth day horny teeth have appeared
  upon all the plates of the mouth-armature, and on the seventeenth day the mouth-apparatus has
  reached the configuration typical of the tadpole, which is now about 14 mm. long. The number of
  horny teeth in <i>R. temporaria</i> amounts to about 640. These teeth are not cuticular products,
  but cornified cells; they are very small, and consist each of one horny cell, which is shaped like
  a nightcap, the apex of which is curved back and serrated. The little teeth are shed continuously,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page59"><span class="smaller">{59}</span></span>the renewal taking place
  by successive cells growing into the bases of the older series. The shape and size differ much in
  the various genera and species. The comb-like plates, composed of those teeth which surround the
  lips, seem to be used chiefly for the fixing or hooking of the food, while those which compose the
  horny beak proper, the armature of the jaws, are used like the radulae of snails. These beaks are
  likewise composed of a great number of individual teeth, closely packed together in several rows,
  but the teeth themselves are simple and not serrated.</p>

  <p>In <i>Hyla arborea</i> there are in all about 560 teeth. The development of the mouth does not
  begin before the eleventh day; the horny teeth break through, and the jaws get black edges, on the
  eighteenth. In <i>Pelobates fuscus</i> the number of horny teeth is increased to about 1100. In
  <i>Borborocoetes taeniatus</i> the horny teeth form series of five bells, which fit into each
  other like the joints of a rattlesnake's tail.</p>

  <p>One of the most extraordinary kinds of tadpoles is that of <i>Megalophrys montana</i>.<a
  id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Mr. Annandale (Skeat Expedition) found it at Bukit
  Besar, Malay Peninsula, from 2000 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. The tadpoles (Fig. 11)
  were found in the beginning of the month of May 1899 in sandy streams and in pools of rain-water;
  they floated in a vertical position, the peculiar membranous funnel-shaped expansion of the lips
  acting as surface-floats. The inside of the funnel is beset with radiating series of little horny
  teeth, and the whole apparatus is possibly used for scraping the under-surface of the leaves of
  water-plants in search of food. Total length of the tadpoles 1 inch.<a id="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The gills, the formation of the operculum, and the modifications of the branchial arterial
  arches have been described fully on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page43">43</a></span>; those of
  the hyo-branchial skeleton on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page31">31</a></span>. Fusion of the
  opercular fold with the skin of the neck, across the branchial region, causes the head to become
  confluent with the trunk (cf. Fig. 9, <span class="smaller">3</span>, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page57">57</a></span>). The body becomes oval, more or less globular, and the alimentary
  canal is greatly elongated and stowed away in the shape of a neat, very regular spiral, shining
  through <span class="pagenum" id="page60"><span class="smaller">{60}</span></span>the ventral wall
  of the body; the anus opens at the end of a somewhat protruding tube, either in the median line,
  just in front of the ventral fin (Discoglossidae, <i>Pelobates</i>, <i>Bufo</i>), or it assumes an
  asymmetrical position by turning to the right side (<i>Hyla</i>, <i>Rana</i>).</p>

      from Bukit Besar, Malay Peninsula. &times; 3.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Although both pairs of limbs begin to bud simultaneously, or the fore-limbs even earlier, the
  hind-limbs are hurried on, and appear first, long before the fore-limbs. The latter lie ready
  beneath the skin of the gill-chamber, and the right always breaks through the skin, while the left
  does the same in the Mediogyrinidae, while in the Laevogyrinidae it is generally pushed through
  the left-sided spiracular opening, immediately behind the outer gills. According to Barfurth the
  right limb appears, in about 80 per cent. of <i>Rana esculenta</i>, from two to eight hours before
  the left.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page61"><span class="smaller">{61}</span></span></div>

  <p>Meanwhile the lungs are being developed, and the tadpole occasionally rises to the surface to
  breathe air. The gills, which, as has been explained elsewhere, are less ancestral than they are
  larval organs, degenerate, and all the organs are modified for the coming terrestrial life. The
  fins of the tail are absorbed, the horny armature of the mouth and lips is shed in pieces and
  makes room for the true teeth, the eyes receive lids, and the whole cranium, especially the
  apparatus of the jaws, undergoes the final modifications&ndash;widening and lengthening of the
  mouth, arresting of the mento-Meckelian cartilages, elongation of the Meckelian cartilages or
  lower jaw proper, shifting backwards of the suspensorium, and lengthening of its orbital process
  to form the pterygo-palatine bridge.</p>

  <p>The tadpole ceases to feed, the whole intestinal canal is voided of its contents, and by
  "histolysis" is thoroughly rebuilt, becoming wider and shrinking to about one-sixth of its
  original length,&ndash;undoing thereby the spiral&ndash;preparatory for the coarser food, which
  consists of insects, worms, and other strictly animal, living matter. Hitherto the tadpoles have
  lived on "mud," confervae, Diatoms, rotting vegetable and animal matter. The anal tube collapses,
  becomes ultimately absorbed, and a new vent is formed at and below the root of the tail.</p>

  <p>Barfurth<a id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> has made interesting observations and
  experiments with regard to the absorption of the tail and other organs which disappear during the
  metamorphosis. This is retarded by low temperature; it is accelerated by rest and freedom from
  mechanical disturbances, as, for instance, concussion of the water. Hunger shortens or hurries on
  the last stages of metamorphosis, the absorption of the tail taking place in four instead of five
  days. Amputation of the tail has no retarding influence; it is followed at once by regeneration,
  although the tadpole may be on the verge of reducing the tail. Whilst hungering the whole organism
  draws upon its available store of material, naturally first upon those parts which sooner or later
  are to become superfluous. This applies eminently to the tail, which represents a considerable
  amount of "edible" matter, and also to that portion of the skin which still covers the fore-limbs.
  The elements of the cutis are resorbed, thereby thinning the skin; and consequently the limbs
  break through earlier in fasting than in well-fed <span class="pagenum" id="page62"><span
  class="smaller">{62}</span></span>specimens. Nature herself seems to apply hunger as an
  accelerator. Mlle. von Chauvin found that the larvae of Urodela normally fast during the
  transformation, and according to Barfurth the larvae of <i>Rana temporaria</i> eat less after
  their hind-limbs are fully developed. This is, however, also preparatory for the reorganisation of
  the gut, which has to be more or less empty during the shortening process.</p>

  <p>The loss of the tail is not due to a sudden dropping off of this organ&ndash;a crude but by no
  means uncommon belief&ndash;but is brought about by a very gradual process of resorbtion. When the
  fore-limbs begin to break through the skin, the tip of the tail shrinks and becomes black, owing
  to an increase, or rather concentration, of the pigment cells. The reduction proceeds from the tip
  forwards until on about the fifth day there remains only a short, conical, black stump. From the
  beginning of this process of reduction the tail is scarcely used for locomotion, the tadpole
  rowing with its legs, or it crawls and hops about, although the tail may still be 20 mm. long. The
  cells of the epidermis atrophy, shrink, and peel off, while those of the cutis, blood-vessels,
  nerves, muscles, and chorda dorsalis become disintegrated, often undergoing fatty degeneration.
  The leucocytes eat up the d&eacute;bris and other dissolved tissue, and carry it away through the
  lymphatic vessels, to be used as new building material in the rest of the animal.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Barfurth asks very properly, Why do these tissues degenerate and die? Because the
  vasomotor nerve-fibres cease to regulate the circulation. And why does this trophic influence of
  the central nervous system stop? Because the function of the tail becomes superfluous through the
  appearance of the fore-limbs. The tail is doomed, and degenerates like any other organ without a
  function. The whole process is, of course, a recapitulation of ancestral, phylogenetic
  evolution.</p>

  class="smaller">NEOTENY&ndash;REGENERATION&ndash;TEMPERATURE&ndash;GEOGRAPHICAL
  DISTRIBUTION</span></p>

  <p><b>Neoteny.</b>&ndash;It has long been known that the larvae of the Spotted Salamander
  occasionally attain the size of 80 mm. or about 3 inches, whilst the majority undergo
  metamorphosis when they are only 40 mm. long. Again, larvae of <i>Triton</i> have been found, in
  the months of April and May, 80 to 90 mm. long, still with functional gills, but with the sexual
  organs fully developed. De Filippi<a id="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> found in one
  locality in Lombardy, besides a few normal fully metamorphosed specimens of only 30 mm. in length,
  more than forty specimens, which, although they had attained full size, about 55 mm., and were
  sexually mature, still retained their gills. According to him such gill-breathing, otherwise
  mature specimens, occur constantly in a small lake in the Val Formazzo, on the Italian slope of
  the Alps, in the province of Ossola. Later Dum&eacute;ril<a id="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
  astonished the world by his account of the metamorphosis of the Mexican gill-breathing Axolotl
  into an entirely lung-breathing and terrestrial creature, hitherto called <i>Amblystoma</i>, and
  supposed to be not only a different species, but to belong to a different family from the Axolotl,
  which was known as <i>Siredon axolotl</i> s. <i>pisciforme</i>, and naturally classed with the
  Perennibranchiata.</p>

  <p>This discovery led to a series of observations and experiments, chiefly conducted by Marie von
  Chauvin, instigated thereto by Koelliker and by Camerano.<a id="NtA_36"
  href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> It was then found that many, if not most of the European
  Amphibia, both Urodela and Anura, <span class="pagenum" id="page64"><span
  class="smaller">{64}</span></span>occasionally postpone their metamorphosis, and also that such
  Urodela sometimes become adult for all practical purposes, but retain their gills.</p>

  <p>This retardation, the retention of larval characters beyond the normal period, was called
  <i>Neotenie</i> by Kollmann<a id="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> (<span title="neos"
  class="fsn">&nu;&#x03AD;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, young; <span title="tein&ocirc;"
  class="fsn">&tau;&epsilon;&#x03AF;&nu;&omega;</span>, extend, stretch). He distinguished further
  between:&ndash;I. <span class="gsp">Partial Neoteny</span>, namely, simple retardation of the
  metamorphosis beyond the normal period, for instance, the wintering of tadpoles of <i>Pelobates
  fuscus</i>, <i>Bombinator pachypus</i>, <i>Pelodytes punctatus</i>, <i>Alytes obstetricans</i>,
  <i>Hyla arborea</i>, <i>Rana esculenta</i>, <i>R. temporaria</i>, <i>Bufo vulgaris</i>, and <i>B.
  viridis</i>: II. <span class="gsp">Total Neoteny</span>, where the animal retains its gills, but
  becomes sexually mature; hitherto observed in Urodela only, e.g. <i>Triton vulgaris</i>, <i>T.
  alpestris</i>, <i>T. cristatus</i>, <i>T. boscai</i>, <i>T. waltli</i> and <i>Amblystoma</i>.
  Intermediate stages between these two categories are not uncommon.</p>

  <p>A satisfactory explanation of the meaning of neoteny is beset with difficulties. Some
  authorities look upon the phenomenon simply as the result of adaptation to the surroundings, which
  make it advantageous for the creature to retain its larval features. Others think that the
  surroundings somehow or other retard or prevent the assumption of the adult characters.
  Undoubtedly there are many cases in which larvae have been reared in water-holes with steep walls,
  so that they could not change from aquatic to terrestrial life, and it stands to reason that
  abnormally forced and prolonged use of the gills and of the tail may stimulate these organs into
  further growth at the expense of the limbs and other organs which are intended for terrestrial
  life. But not unfrequently typical neotenic and overgrown specimens occur side by side with others
  which have completed their metamorphosis, and the same is true of larvae of newts which were
  reared, for experimental purposes, under exactly the same conditions&ndash;for instance, in a
  high-walled glass vessel.</p>

  <p>Weismann tried to explain neoteny as cases of reversion to atavistic ancestral conditions, but
  this idea is based upon an assumption which is probably wrong. His idea necessitates the
  supposition that all the Amphibia were originally gill-breathing, aquatic, and limbless animals,
  and that every feature seen in a larva must necessarily indicate an ancestral phylogenetic stage.
  It is, on the contrary, much more probable that <span class="pagenum" id="page65"><span
  class="smaller">{65}</span></span>the external gills of the Urodela have been developed in
  adaptation to their embryonic and larval, essentially aquatic, life. Consequently the possession
  of such gills would be a secondary, and not, strictly speaking, an atavistic feature. Normal loss
  of these gills, exclusively pulmonary respiration, and preponderating terrestrial life
  characterise the final adult Amphibian. These cases of neoteny are therefore instances of more or
  less complete retardation, or of the retention, of partially larval conditions.</p>

  <p>The whole problem is, however, by no means simple. <i>Salamandra atra</i> has become
  viviparous, and the whole metamorphosis takes place within the uterus; in fact, the young have an
  embryonic, but no larval period, if by the latter we understand the free swimming and still
  imperfect stage. Similarly, various Anura&ndash;for instance, <i>Hylodes
  martinicensis</i>&ndash;pass rapidly through their metamorphosis, and have suppressed the stage of
  free swimming tadpoles. On the other hand, in many newts, the duration of the larval period is
  much prolonged, and moreover is very subject to individual variation. In the Axolotl this larval
  period is continued until and after sexual maturity is reached. The extreme condition would then
  be represented by the Perennibranchiate genera. It may seem reasonable to look upon these as the
  youngest members of the Urodela, and the loss of the maxillae in the Sirenidae and Proteidae
  supports this idea. But it so happens that the majority of the most neotenic genera are more
  primitive in the composition of the skull and the vertebral column than the typically terrestrial
  and rapidly metamorphosing genera. Witness the amphicoelous vertebrae, the completeness of the
  pterygoids, the separate nature of the palatine bones, and the separate splenials, as mentioned in
  detail in the description of their skull.</p>

  <p>We have therefore to conclude, first, that the various Perennibranchiate genera do not form a
  natural group, but are a heterogeneous assembly; secondly, that they have become Perennibranchiate
  at a phylogenetically old stage&ndash;in fact, that they are the oldest, and not the newest,
  members of the present Urodela. At the same time, it would be erroneous to suppose that the first
  Urodela were aquatic creatures, provided with a finny tail, with small, ill-developed lungs, and
  with epidermal sense organs. All these features are, on the contrary, directly correlated with
  aquatic life, and are larval acquisitions, not ancestral <span class="pagenum" id="page66"><span
  class="smaller">{66}</span></span>reminiscences. It would be equally wrong to allude to the
  absence of lungs in many newts as a piscine and therefore ancestral feature. The development of
  the typical pentadactyloid limb, the connexion of the pelvic girdle with the vertebral column, the
  development of the lungs, and absolute suppression of internal gills point without doubt to
  terrestrial creatures. What then, may we ask, were the first Amphibia like? and how about the
  external gills? They were undoubtedly akin to the less specialised Lepospondylous Stegocephali, in
  particular the gill-less Microsauri, and the various stages may perhaps be reconstructed as
  follows:&ndash;</p>

  <p>(1) Terrestrial, with two pairs of pentadactyloid limbs; breathing by lungs only; with a fully
  developed apparatus of five pairs of gill-arches, which during the embryonic life perhaps still
  carried internal gills; with or without several pairs of gill-clefts. Reduction of the dermal
  armour and of the cutaneous scutes had taken place.</p>

  <p>(2) Additional respiratory organs were developed by the embryo, in the shape of external gills;
  these were at first restricted to embryonic life (as in the existing Apoda), but were gradually
  used also during the aquatic life of the larva. These external gills, together with the lungs,
  have superseded the internal gills, of which there are now no traces either in Urodela or in
  Anura.</p>

  <p>(3<i>a</i>) Some Urodeles, retaking to aquatic life, retained and further enlarged the external
  gills into more or less permanent organs (cf. also <i>Siren</i>, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page136">136</a></span>).</p>

  <p>(3<i>b</i>) The majority of Urodela hurried through the larval, aquatic stage, and
  some&ndash;e.g. <i>Salamandra atra</i>&ndash;became absolutely terrestrial. The possession of
  unusually long external gills by this species and by the Apoda indicate that these organs are
  essentially embryonic, not larval, features.</p>

  <p><b>Regeneration.</b>&ndash;Most Amphibia possess the faculty of regenerating mutilated or lost
  limbs. This takes place the more certainly and quickly the younger the animal. The amputation
  necessary to study these phenomena need not be experimental. Axolotls and other Urodelous larvae
  frequently maim each other fearfully, by biting off the gills or one or more limbs. The gills do
  not even require amputation. If the larvae are kept in stagnant water the gills often shrivel up
  or slough off and grow again. <span class="pagenum" id="page67"><span
  class="smaller">{67}</span></span>The same applies to the larvae of viviparous species, e.g.
  <i>Salamandra atra</i>, which, when cut out of the uterus and put into water, soon cast off their
  long, tender gills and produce a stronger set. In an Axolotl,<a id="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> two years old, a hand was cut off. After four weeks there was a
  conical stump; after the sixth week this stump had two points; in the eleventh week three or four
  fingers were discernible, and a week later the complete hand. Frequently these creatures reproduce
  five instead of the normal four fingers. But the more proximal the cut, the more liable is the new
  limb to reproduce supernumerary fingers, or even extra hands and feet. Complete regeneration of
  the limb, cut off in the middle of the humerus, took place within five months.</p>

  <p><i>Triton taeniatus</i>, adult, reproduces cut fingers within five or six weeks, and if the
  hand be cut above the carpus, new finger-stumps appear in about one month. G&ouml;tte has observed that
  an adult <i>Proteus</i> did not completely reproduce its whole leg until after eighteen months;
  and, according to Spallanzani, more than one year elapses before the limb, bones, and cartilages
  of <i>Triton</i> regain their normal strength.</p>

  <p>The Anura are likewise capable of regenerating their limbs, the more readily the younger the
  specimens. For instance, in a tadpole of <i>Rana temporaria</i>, in which the fore-limbs were
  still hidden, the hind-limb, cut at the middle of the thigh, reproduced nineteen days later a
  knee, followed by a short two-toed stump. Ultimately the whole limb became completed. The tail of
  tadpoles regenerates very quickly and completely, even if it be cut off shortly before the final
  metamorphosis, when the tail would in any case be reduced. Metamorphosed Anura have almost
  entirely lost this faculty, but not absolutely. I myself have kept two specimens of <i>Rana
  temporaria</i>, which, when already adult, had each lost a hand at the wrist. First there was only
  the clean-cut stump with a scar, but within a year this changed into a four-cornered stump, and
  two of the protuberances developed a little further, reaching a length of about 4 mm. These
  specimens lived for four years without further changes.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Temperature.</b>&ndash;Amphibia, like Fishes and Reptiles, are, as a rule,
  classed as cold-blooded animals, in opposition to the warm-blooded Birds and Mammals. This
  distinction is one of degree only. The terms poikilothermous and homothermous (<span
  title="poikilos" class="fsn">&pi;&omicron;&#x03AF;&kappa;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page68"><span class="smaller">{68}</span></span>variable; <span
  title="homos" class="fsn">&#x1F45;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, equable) are based upon a sounder
  principle, but are likewise liable to exceptions. Those creatures which, like Birds and Mammals,
  possess a specific temperature of their own under normal conditions, that of hibernation being
  excepted, are homothermous. Cold-blooded creatures have no specific temperature; they more or less
  assume that of their surroundings. Frogs and newts, for instance, when living in the water,
  naturally assume its temperature, which is, of course, many degrees lower in a cold spring than in
  a shallow pond warmed by the sun on a hot summer's day. The same applies to the changes from day
  to night. Dark-coloured tortoises basking in the sun are sometimes so hot that they are
  disagreeable to touch, since they possess but little mechanism for regulating their heat. The same
  individual cools down during a chilly night by perhaps 40&deg; C. Anura are, however, very susceptible
  to heat; most of them die when their temperature rises to about 40&deg; C. Under such conditions they
  die quickly when in the water, but in the air their moist skin counteracts the heat, lowering it
  by evaporation; otherwise it would be impossible for a tree-frog to sit in the glaring sun in a
  temperature of 120&deg; F. Toads and others with drier skins seek the shade, hide under stones, or
  bury themselves in the coolest spots available, and many Amphibia and Reptiles aestivate in a
  torpid condition during the dry and hot season. Many of them can endure a surprising amount of
  cold, and during hibernation their temperature may sink to freezing-point. This power of endurance
  does not apply to all alike; tropical species can stand less than those which live in temperate
  and cold regions. In spite of many assertions to the contrary, it may safely be stated that none
  of our European frogs, toads, and newts survive being frozen hard. They may be cooled down to
  nearly -1&deg; C., and they may be partially frozen into the ice. Circulation of the blood is
  suspended in such cooled-down frogs; their limbs may become so hard that they break like a piece
  of wood, but the citadel of life, the heart, must not sink much below freezing-point, and must
  itself not be frozen, if the animal is to have a chance of recovering. The protoplasm resists a
  long time, and so long as some of it is left unfrozen the rest will recover. Hibernating frogs are
  lost if they are reached by prolonged frost during exceptionally severe winters. Every frog will
  be killed in an artificial pond with a clean concrete bottom, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page69"><span class="smaller">{69}</span></span>but if there is sufficient mud, with decaying
  vegetable matter, the creatures survive, simply because they are not absolutely frozen. A severe
  winter not infrequently kills off all the younger creatures, while the older and more experienced
  hide themselves more carefully and live to propagate the race.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Geographical Distribution.</b></p>

  <p>There is a very ably written chapter on the geographical distribution of the Amphibia by
  Boulenger in the <i>Catalogue of Batrachia Gradientia</i>, pp. 104-118. He came to the important
  conclusion that the geographical distribution of the Amphibia agrees in general with that of the
  freshwater fishes. G&uuml;nther's division into a Northern, Equatorial, and Southern zone is modified
  only in so far as the last two are combined into one, "Tasmania and Patagonia not differing in any
  point regarding their Frog Fauna from Australia and South America respectively."</p>

  <p>In the chapter on geographical distribution in Bronn's <i>Thierreich, V&ouml;gel, Systematischer
  Theil</i>, p. 296 (1893), and in my <i>Classification of Vertebrata</i> (1898), due attention had
  been paid to the Amphibia as well as to the other classes of Vertebrata. It will be seen in the
  following pages that my arrangement is well applicable to the Amphibia so far as fundamental
  principles are concerned.</p>

  <p>It cannot be sufficiently emphasised that any attempt to form the various faunas of the
  different classes of animals into one scheme must necessarily be a <i>petitio principii</i>. The
  time-honoured six zoo-geographical regions established by Sclater and Wallace represent fairly
  well the main continental divisions: North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and the
  large northern continental mass of the Old World, with India as a tropical appendix. There is no
  correlation and no subordination <span class="pagenum" id="page70"><span
  class="smaller">{70}</span></span>in this scheme. Huxley's division (1868) into <span
  class="sc">Notogaea</span> and <span class="sc">Arctogaea</span> (see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page74">74</a></span>) is of fundamental importance. The next improvement was the
  combination of the Palaearctic and Nearctic "regions" into one, an advance originally due to
  Professor Newton, carried out by Heilprin (1887) as the Holarctic region. I have, in 1893,
  substituted for it the more appropriate term <i>Periarctic</i>, meaning the whole mass of land
  which lies around the indifferent Arctic zone. The want of further co-ordination and subordination
  required the combination of the African and Oriental or Indian countries into a <i>Palaeotropical
  region</i> (1893); the Ethiopian or African and the Indian or Oriental regions of Sclater and
  Wallace thereby assuming their proper subordinate rank of subregions.</p>

  <p>The two primary divisions <span class="sc">Notogaea</span> and <span
  class="sc">Arctogaea</span> are fundamental. The four secondary divisions, namely the
  <i>Australian</i> and <i>Neotropical</i>, <i>Periarctic</i> and <i>Palaeotropical regions</i>,
  also stand the test of application to the various classes and main groups of Vertebrata; but
  naturally, under the present configuration of the world, the Palaeotropical region is nothing but
  the Southern continuation of the Eastern half of the Periarctic mass of land. This is especially
  obvious so far as India is concerned. There is, however, that broad belt of desert, sand, and
  salt-steppes, which extends from North-West Africa to Manchuria, and this belt is one of the most
  important physical features of the Old World. It is complicated by the system of mountain-chains
  which, broadly speaking, centre at the Pamirs, and radiate westwards through the Caucasus and Alps
  into Spain, eastwards through the Himalayas into China, and north-eastwards to Kamtschatka;
  interrupted by Bering's Sea, it is continued as the backbone of both Americas to Patagonia.</p>

  <p>The tertiary divisions, the subregions, have no real existence. They depend upon the class, or
  even order, of animals, which we happen to study. The faunistic distribution of the Urodela is not
  that of the Anura, and both follow separate lines of dispersal, different from those of the
  various orders of Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals. This must be so. There is no doubt that the
  distribution of land and water was totally different in the Coal Age from what it is now. The face
  of the globe at the Jurassic Age can scarcely be compared with the aspect which the world has
  assumed in the Miocene period.</p>

  <p>This leads to another consideration, often neglected.  We <span class="pagenum"
  id="page71"><span class="smaller">{71}</span></span>know that the various classes, orders,
  families, etc., of animals have appeared successively upon the stage. A group which arose in the
  Coal Age followed lines of dispersal different from one which was not evolved until Jurassic
  times, and post-cretaceous creatures could not avail themselves of what assisted their ancestors,
  and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The Amphibia are bound absolutely to the land and to fresh water;
  transportation across salt water is not excluded, but must be accidental, and is not a case of
  regular "spreading." Speaking generally, the older a group, the more likely is it to be widely
  distributed. If it appears scattered, this may be due to extinction in intermediate countries or
  to submergence of former land-connexions.</p>

  <p>There is great danger of arguing in a circle. It is one of the most difficult tasks to decide
  in cases of great resemblance of groups of animals between their being due to direct affinity or
  to heterogeneous convergence, or parallel development. It is the morphologist who is ultimately
  responsible for the establishment of faunistic regions, not the systematist, least of all he who
  accepts an elaborate classification, and then mechanically, mathematically, by lists of genera and
  species, maps out the world. Let us take an example. The Neotropical region and Madagascar, but
  not Africa, are supposed to be faunistically related to each other. In both namely occur
  <i>Boa</i> and <i>Corallus</i> amongst snakes, Dendrobatinae amongst Ranidae, and of the
  Insectivora <i>Solenodon</i> in Cuba, <i>Centetes</i> in Madagascar. More cases can no doubt be
  found which would strengthen this resemblance, perhaps in support of the startling view that
  Madagascar and South America have received part of their fauna from the famous Antarctica. But the
  value of the Insectivores has been disposed of by their recognition as an extremely ancient group,
  or as a case of convergence, and the two genera are no longer put into the same family as
  Centetidae. The Dendrobatinae (<i>Mantella</i> in Madagascar, the others in South America) are
  decidedly not a natural group, but an instance of very recent convergence (cf. <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page272">272</a></span>). About the members of the ancient Boidae we do
  not feel quite so sure.</p>

  <p>It is therefore advisable to eliminate for zoogeographical purposes groups about which there
  can be any reasonable doubt, otherwise we may argue that certain genera must constitute a very old
  family, because they are now restricted to widely <span class="pagenum" id="page72"><span
  class="smaller">{72}</span></span>separated countries, or on the strength of their distribution we
  may conclude that the genera in question cannot be related to each other, and do not belong to the
  same sub-family or family as the case may be. Such groups are the Engystomatinae and the genus
  <i>Spelerpes</i>; amongst reptiles the Eublepharidae, Helodermatidae, Anelytropidae, Ilysiidae,
  Amblycephalidae.</p>

  <p>It is customary to represent the various regions and sub-regions as if they had boundaries as
  fixed as political frontiers. Such limitations are quite arbitrary, and what is of more
  importance, they differ in reality according to the class or order of animals with which we happen
  to deal. Moreover, there has been, and is probably still going on, an exchange or overlapping of
  faunas. Such debatable grounds are Central America and the highlands of North-western South
  America. The famous Wallace's line, between Borneo and Celebes, Java and Lombok, is absolutely
  inapplicable to the Anura. From their point of view the Austro-Malayan countries, Papuasia and
  Polynesia do not form a sub-region of the Australian, but rather of the Palaeotropical region.
  Concerning the Urodela, the division into Palae- and Ne-arctic sub-regions is unjustifiable since
  Eastern Asia has emphatically American affinities (cf. also <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page96">96</a></span>). The Sahara and the rest of Northern Africa are intimately connected
  with Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, and Northern India, just as equatorial Africa and Madagascar
  possess strong faunistic relationship with Southern India and the Malay islands.</p>

  <p><i>Limiting factors of distribution.</i>&ndash;Common salt is poison to the Amphibia; even a
  solution of 1 per cent prevents the development of their larvae. Consequently seas, salt lakes,
  and plains encrusted with saline deposits act as most efficient boundaries to normal "spreading."
  But undoubtedly many individuals have made long and successful voyages across the seas on floating
  trees. Solutions of lime are likewise detrimental to many species, and it is a general fact that
  limestone-terrain is poor in Amphibian life, unless, of course, sufficient accumulation of humus
  counteracts or prevents the calcareous impregnation of the springs and pools in meadows.
  <i>Salamandra maculosa</i> is, for instance, absent in Central Germany on the Muschelkalk, but it
  occurs in abundance in neighbouring districts of red sandstone or granite; nor can the larvae be
  reared successfully in very "hard" water. On the other hand, <i>Proteus</i> lives in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page73"><span class="smaller">{73}</span></span>subterranean waters of
  Carniola, where the whole country is nothing but limestone.</p>

  <p>Cold is another powerful limiting factor. The absolute northern limit of Amphibian life
  coincides rather closely with the somewhat erratic line of 0&deg; Centigrade of annual mean
  temperature, a little to the north of which line the ground remains permanently frozen below the
  surface. The surface-crust, which thaws during the summer, engenders an abundance of insects as
  food-supply, but its freezing down to the icy bottom makes hibernation impossible. There are, of
  course, some exceptions, for instance the occurrence of Urodela in the Schilka river and in the
  district of Lake Baikal.</p>

  <p>Ranges of mountains are far less effective barriers than is generally supposed. In many cases
  the fauna is the same on either slope, and they act rather as equalising or dispersing factors,
  especially when they extend from north to south. Witness the Andes, owing to which Ecuador and
  Peru bear a great resemblance to the Central American fauna, and differ from the tropical parts of
  South America. The existence of an <i>Amblystoma</i> in Siam is another instance.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The more specialised a family the more intimately is it connected with the physical
  features of the country. Typically arboreal frogs are dependent on the presence of trees. Some
  have undoubtedly spread into treeless countries and have changed into prairie-frogs, e.g.
  <i>Acris</i>. They come out, so to speak, as something different at the other end, and it is
  unlikely that these modified descendants redevelop exactly the same features as their ancestors
  before the migration. Baldwin Spencer<a id="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> met with
  only six species of frogs in Central Australia, <i>Limnodynastes</i>, <i>Chiroleptes</i>,
  <i>Heleioporus</i>, and <i>Hyla</i>. They are in the main identical with certain forms found in
  the dry inland parts of New South Wales and Queensland. They are to be regarded as immigrants from
  the latter regions, which have been able in the majority of cases to adapt themselves to
  unfavourable climatic conditions by means of a marked development of the burrowing habit, to which
  in certain cases has been added a capacity for absorbing and holding water.</p>

  <p><span class="smaller">* indicates Amphibia which are peculiar to the respective regions or

  <p>Characterised by the Cystignathidae* and by the predominance of Arcifera, which form nearly 90
  per cent of the Anurous population.</p>

  <p>I. <span class="sc">Australian region.</span>&ndash;Absence of Apoda and Urodela. All the Anura
  are arciferous, with the exception of one species of <i>Rana</i> in the Cape York peninsula. The
  fauna of the Australian continent and of Tasmania consists chiefly of Cystignathidae and Hylidae
  (<i>Hyla</i> and <i>Hylella</i>) and several small genera of Bufonidae (<i>Pseudophryne</i>,*
  <i>Notaden</i>,* and <i>Myobatrachus</i>*).</p>

  <p>It is customary, and from the study of other Vertebrata quite justifiable, to divide the
  Australian region into several sub-regions, but the Amphibia lend no support to this. The only
  Amphibian in the Sandwich Islands is a <i>Bufo</i>, closely related to North American species. The
  only Amphibian in New Zealand is <i>Liopelma</i>,* one of the Discoglossidae which are otherwise
  confined to Europe, North-east Asia, and North-west America, and, to judge from their low
  organisation, had formerly a much wider distribution. New Caledonia possesses no Amphibia. The
  Fiji Islands are inhabited by one or two species of <i>Cornufer</i>, a genus of Ranidae. The same
  genus is typical of the Austro-Malayan and Papuasian islands, the fauna of which consists of
  <i>Rana</i> and <i>Cornufer</i>, <i>Ceratobatrachus</i>, several genera of Engystomatinae,
  Hylidae, and Pelobatidae.</p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">Neotropical region</span>.&ndash;Characterised by Apoda, Aglossa
  (<i>Pipa</i>), abundance of Cystignathidae (Hemiphractinae,* Cystignathinae, and
  Dendrophryniscinae*), Hylidae (Hylinae and Amphignathodontinae*), numerous Bufonidae and
  Engystomatinae; Dendrobatinae*; the Raninae are represented by a few peculiar genera, mostly
  restricted to the Andesian province; the genus <i>Rana</i> occurs there in a few species only.</p>

  <p>Absence of Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae and Dyscophinae.</p>

  <p>Several species of Urodela, of the genus <i>Spelerpes</i>, extend from Central America into the
  Andesian province, one occurs in Hayti, and <i>Plethodon platense</i> in Argentina.</p>

  <p>This region is by far the richest in the number of families, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page75"><span class="smaller">{75}</span></span>genera and species; the total number of the
  latter being, according to Boulenger, about four-ninths of the known species. The region comprises
  South America, Central America, and the West Indian islands. Central America is naturally
  debatable ground; one species of <i>Hylodes</i> and one <i>Engystoma</i>, besides about twenty
  Hylidae, extend into North America proper, while possibly the Raninae have entered the Neotropical
  region from the north. <i>Bufo</i> is too cosmopolitan to assist our conclusions. The occurrence
  of four species of <i>Hylella</i> in South America, one in Australia, and one in New Guinea
  indicate that this is not a natural genus.</p>

  <p class="sp3">From the point of the Amphibia the whole region can be divided into <span
  class="gsp">two sub-regions</span> only: (1) The West Indian islands with Central America and the
  north-western Andesian province; (2) the rest of South America.</p>

  almost peculiar to the region (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page96">96</a></span>). Absence
  of Apoda. Presence of Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae, Bufonidae, Raninae. Few Hylinae occur.</p>

  <p>The whole region can be subdivided into <span class="gsp">three sub-regions</span>.</p>

  <p>1. <span class="gsp">Western Palaearctic.</span>&ndash;Prevalence of Salamandrinae

  <i>Bombinator</i>, <i>Alytes</i>,* <i>Bufo</i>, <i>Hyla arborea</i>, <i>Pelobates</i>,*
  <i>Pelodytes</i>,* <i>Rana</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="gsp">Eastern Palaearctic.</span>&ndash;Amphiumidae (<i>Cryptobranchus</i>);
  Salamandrinae (<i>Triton</i>, <i>Pachytriton</i>,* <i>Tylototriton</i>*);
  Amblystomatinae.&ndash;<i>Bombinator</i>, <i>Bufo</i>, <i>Hyla arborea</i>, <i>Rana</i>,
  <i>Rhacophorus</i>.</p>

  <p>3. <span class="gsp">Nearctic.</span>&ndash;Amphiumidae (<i>Cryptobranchus</i>,
  <i>Amphiuma</i>*); Proteidae (<i>Typhlomolge</i>,* <i>Necturus</i>*); Sirenidae*; Amblystomatinae;
  most Plethodontinae; Desmognathinae.*&ndash;Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae (<i>Scaphiopus</i>*);
  <i>Bufo</i>; Hylidae (<i>Hyla</i>, <i>Acris</i>, <i>Chorophilus</i>); <i>Rana</i>.</p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">Palaeotropical region.</span>&ndash;Characterised by the presence of Apoda
  and by the great prevalence of Firmisternal Anura, which amount to nearly 90 per cent of the total
  population. <span class="pagenum" id="page76"><span class="smaller">{76}</span></span>Absence of
  Urodela (except <i>Amblystoma persimile</i>*), of Cystignathidae, and practically of the Hylidae,
  only two of which occur in the Himalayan district. But this great chain of mountains should not be
  included within the region, while the outlying spurs in Upper Burma (with <i>Amblystoma</i>) are
  debatable ground. The subdivision of this widely extended region is beset with difficulties,
  chiefly on account of Madagascar and Papuasia. The fauna of Madagascar is very remarkable. All its
  Amphibia are Firmisternal, a mixture of African and Indian forms. The island agrees with Africa,
  in opposition to the Oriental countries, in no special point; all the Raninae, except
  <i>Megalixalus</i>, <i>Rappia</i>, and two rather common species of <i>Rana</i>, belong to
  different genera. Madagascar differs from Africa by the absence of Apoda, of Aglossa, and
  Bufonidae. On the other hand, it agrees with India or with the Malay islands, in opposition to
  Africa, by the possession of Dyscophinae, of the Ranine genus <i>Rhacophorus</i>, and the
  Engystomatine genus <i>Calophrynus</i>.</p>

  <p>Africa and India agree with each other, and differ from Madagascar by the possession of Apoda,
  the genera <i>Bufo</i> and <i>Nectophryne</i>, and by the close resemblance of several genera of
  Raninae.</p>

  <p>India, the Malay islands, and Papuasia with Melanesia possess Pelobatidae
  (<i>Leptobrachium</i>,* <i>Batrachopsis</i>,* <i>Asterophrys</i>*), and thereby differ
  considerably from Africa and Madagascar. <i>Batrachylodes</i>* of the Solomon Islands has
  unmistakable affinities with <i>Phrynoderma</i>* of Karen, between Burma and Siam;
  <i>Oreobatrachus</i>* of Borneo much resembles <i>Phrynobatrachus</i>* of West Africa; and
  <i>Cornufer</i>, typical of the Malay and Melanesian islands, occurs also in West Africa. All
  these Raninae indicate that the Austro-Malayan and Melanesian islands belong to the Palaeotropical
  region. <i>Ceratobatrachus</i>,* type of a sub-family, is peculiar to Melanesia.</p>

  <p>There are consequently several possible modes of subdivision, all with a different result,
  according to the group of Amphibia, which we may select as of leading importance, <i>e.g.</i>
  Apoda or Pelobatidae, or Dyscophinae and <i>Rhacophorus</i>. The Engystomatinae and Raninae are to
  be eliminated, since they occur in all the countries in question. We have either to leave the
  whole region undivided&ndash;and it is a significant fact that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page77"><span class="smaller">{77}</span></span>Indian countries possess not one sub-family of
  their own&ndash;or we must break it up into four provinces, not sub-regions:&ndash;</p>

  PHRACTAMPHIBIA</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>With a considerable amount of dermal armour, especially on the head.</i></p>

  <p>The earliest known terrestrial four-footed creatures occur in the Carboniferous strata of
  Europe and North America. They and their immediate allies, which extend through the Permian into
  the Upper Trias, are now comprised under the name of <span class="sc">Stegocephali</span>, so
  called because the whole of the dorsal side of the cranium is covered, or roofed over, by dermal
  bones (<span title="stegos" class="fsn">&sigma;&tau;&#x03AD;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, roof;
  <span title="kephal&ecirc;" class="fsn">&kappa;&epsilon;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&#x03AE;</span>, head). That
  these creatures, of which naturally only the skeletal parts are known, were not fishes, is shown
  by the typically pentadactyloid limbs; but to recognise them as Amphibia, and as distinct from
  Reptiles, is difficult, especially if the incipient Reptilia, which have sprung from some members
  of this Stegocephalous stock, are taken into account. However, they possess either two occipital
  condyles, or none, and their vertebrae are either pseudocentrous or notocentrous, but not
  gastrocentrous. Moreover, the whole skeletal organisation is still so ideally generalised, that it
  is easy to derive directly from it the arrangement prevailing in the Apoda and Urodela.</p>

  <p>The vertebral column always comprises a well-developed, sometimes a very long tail. The
  vertebrae exhibit three types, two of which are fundamentally distinct, while the third is a
  further development of the second.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Lepospondylous and pseudocentrous.</i>&ndash;The vertebra consists of a thin shell of
  bone surrounding the chorda dorsalis, and is composed of two pairs of arcualia, which meet each
  other, <span class="pagenum" id="page79"><span class="smaller">{79}</span></span>forming a suture,
  along the lateral side of the vertebra, both partaking in the formation of a transverse process
  which carries the rib.</p>

  <p>2<i>a</i>. <i>Temnospondylous.</i>&ndash;The vertebra is composed of three pairs of units,
  which remain in a separate, unfused state. Two of them are dorsal arcualia, one of which tends to
  form the centrum of the vertebra, which then carries the neural arch.</p>

  <p>2<i>b</i>. <i>Stereospondylous.</i>&ndash;The three component units fuse by co-ossification
  into a solid, amphicoelous vertebra.</p>

  <p>The ribs are one- or two-headed, rather strong, but short, rarely reaching half-way round the
  body. They occur on all the vertebrae of the trunk and on most of those of the tail. One pair of
  ribs connects one vertebra, the sacral, with the pelvis, of which the ilium and ischium are
  generally ossified, rarely also a portion of the pubic region.</p>

  <p>The shoulder-girdle is very primitive, greatly resembling that of the Crossopterygian fishes.
  It consists of the following bones:&ndash;a median, rhombic, or <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle, a pair of clavicles, of cleithra, of coracoids, and of
  scapulae. The limbs show the typical pentadactyle plan, but even in these earliest Tetrapoda the
  hand possesses only four fingers, with 2, 2, 3, 2 phalanges respectively. The foot has five toes,
  with 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, or 2, 2, 3, 4, 3 phalanges.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Many Stegocephali were possessed of a dermal armour, covering either the whole body
  or only the under parts. Hence the term Phractamphibia (<span title="phraktos"
  class="fsn">&phi;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&#x03CC;&sigmaf;</span>, armoured). The armour consists
  of a great number of small cutaneous scales, partly calcified, or perhaps ossified, and arranged
  in many more or less transverse rows. We can only surmise that these scales were covered by
  corresponding epidermal sheaths. The skull is ideally complete in the number of separate bones
  which appear on its surface. Besides the outer nares and the orbits there is always an unpaired,
  small, interparietal foramen. The whole temporal region is completely roofed over. The following
  bones are present:&ndash;nasals, frontals, parietals, supra- and latero-occipitals; lacrymals
  (unless fused with the jugals?), prefrontals, postfrontals, postorbitals, squamosals, and epi-(or
  opisth-)otics; premaxillaries, maxillaries, jugals, quadrato-jugals, and supra-temporals;
  quadrates, pterygoids, palatines, vomers, and an unpaired parasphenoid.&ndash;The lower jaw is
  composed of a pair of dentaries, <span class="pagenum" id="page80"><span
  class="smaller">{80}</span></span>articulars, angulars, and splenials. The dentaries and
  apparently sometimes the splenials, the palatines, maxillae, and vomers carry teeth. The eyes
  possess a ring of sclerotic bones.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. STEGOCEPHALI LEPOSPONDYLI.</b></p>

  <p>Vertebrae pseudocentrous.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Branchiosauri.</b>&ndash;The young had several pairs of gill-arches, which, to
  judge from their size and from the fact that they are beset with numerous nodules, denticles, or
  irregular little processes like gill-rakers&ndash;seem to have been exposed to the surface and to
  have carried gills. In the adult the arches and gills seem to be absent.</p>

  <p>One of the commonest genera is <i>Branchiosaurus</i>, including <i>Protriton</i>. <i>B.
  salamandroides</i> of the Lower Red Sandstone of Europe is known in every stage, from larvae of 16
  mm. to the full grown animal of 64 mm. in length. The whole body was <span class="pagenum"
  id="page81"><span class="smaller">{81}</span></span>covered with little cutaneous scales.
  <i>Pelosaurus</i> and perhaps <i>Melanerpeton</i> are allied genera.</p>

  <p>The following genera are small newt-like creatures of the Carboniferous age of Europe and North
  America. In <i>Keraterpeton</i> of Bohemia, Ireland, and Ohio, the dermal scales were restricted
  to the under parts; and the ribs were rather long, reaching half way round the body. Gills have
  not been observed. <i>K. crassum</i>, a European species, reached more than one foot in length,
  two-thirds of which fall to the tail. The ventral side is covered with a most elaborate armour,
  which consists of about eighty chevron-shaped rows of little scale-shaped nodules. The epiotic
  bones end in strange processes, carrying a pair of spikes, giving the skull a "horned" appearance,
  hence the generic name. <i>Urocordylus</i> is an allied genus.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Aistopodes.</b>&ndash;Body snake-like and without any limbs, hence the name
  <span title="aistos" class="fsn">&#x1F04;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, unseen; ribs
  long, and reaching half way round the body; from Carboniferous strata in Ireland and Bohemia, with
  allied, or perhaps identical forms in Ohio. <i>Dolichosoma longissimum</i> possessed more than 150
  vertebrae, and was about a yard long. The epiotics end in obtuse projections, recalling those of
  <i>Keraterpeton</i>. These marvellous creatures had strange appendages, extending from behind the
  sides of the head, which were possibly the supports of external gills; since the upper end of one
  of the visceral arches, probably the hyoidean arch, is attached to the labyrinthic region, and
  from this arch starts a bony rod which carries long skeletal filaments. The body seems to have
  been naked.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Ophiderpeton</i> had a compound ventral shield, while the skin of the back
  contained granular scutes. Although the Aistopodes have, not without reason, been looked upon as
  greatly resembling the Coeciliae or Apoda in organisation, especially in that of the vertebral
  column, the total absence of any other fossils which might bridge over the enormous gulf between
  the Coal Age and recent times, makes the attempt to derive the Apoda from these creatures very
  hazardous.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. STEGOCEPHALI TEMNOSPONDYLI.</b></p>

  <p>Mostly with rather long ribs and with chiefly ventral armour.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page82"><span class="smaller">{82}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Chelydosaurus</i> from the Lower Red Sandstone of Bohemia was 3 feet long, and possessed a
  beautiful, complicated, ventral armour, consisting of about sixty chevron-shaped rows, about three
  times as numerous as the vertebrae in the corresponding region. <i>Sphenosaurus</i> from the same
  strata and localities must have been 2 yards long. The trunk-vertebrae of both these genera were
  composed of four pairs of arcualia. <i>Trimerorhachis</i> from the Permian of Texas is very
  imperfectly known, but its trunk-vertebrae, as the name implies, consist of three pairs of
  separate arcualia, one of which, the interdorsal pair, tends to form a kind of centrum.</p>

  <p><i>Dissorophus multicinctus</i>, also from the Permian of Texas, has been described by Cope<a
  id="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> as a "Batrachian Armadillo," and considered allied
  to <i>Trimerorhachis</i>. Ten vertebrae are known, of an aggregate length of 93 mm.; the length of
  the creature was perhaps one yard. The neural spines are elevated, and the apex of each extends in
  an arch on each side to the ribs. These spinous branches touch each other, forming a carapace.
  Above, and corresponding to each of them, is a similar dermal and osseous element, which extends
  from side to side without interruption in the median line, forming a dermal layer of transverse
  bands which correspond to the skeletal carapace beneath it. This creature remotely approaches the
  genus <i>Zatachys</i>, Cope, where a dermosteous scute is co-ossified with the apex of the neural
  spine. The systematic position of this genus is at least doubtful.</p>

  <p><i>Archegosaurus decheni</i> from the Lower Red of Germany, known by many well-preserved
  specimens, reached a length of 4 or 5 feet. The trunk vertebrae are tri-partite, those of the tail
  quadri-partite, like those of the trunk of <i>Chelydosaurus</i>. Young specimens show traces of
  gill-arches. The thoroughly terrestrial walking limbs have four fingers and four toes; the
  arrangement of the tarsalia, most of which are ossified, lend support to the view that the
  morphological axis went through femur, fibula, intermedium, the centralia, the second distal
  tarsale, and the second toe. The dentine and enamel of the teeth are much folded, and this
  feature, which applies to most members of this Order, to a lesser degree also to others, has
  caused them to be comprised under the name of <span class="sc">Labyrinthodonta</span>. The upper
  <span class="pagenum" id="page83"><span class="smaller">{83}</span></span>surface of the head
  shows very characteristically arranged grooves, which probably contained slime-canals and possibly
  sensory organs.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Actinodon</i> and <i>Euchirosaurus</i> are closely allied forms, chiefly from
  the Lower Red Sandstone of France; <i>Gondwanosaurus</i> occurs in the Permian of India.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. STEGOCEPHALI STEREOSPONDYLI.</b></p>

  <p>These are the most highly developed members of the typical Labyrinthodonta, characterised by
  their much-folded teeth, and by their solid, bi-concave vertebrae. <i>Loxomma</i> occurs in the
  Upper Carboniferous of England and in the Lower Red of Bohemia: <i>Trematosaurus</i>,
  <i>Capitosaurus</i>, and <i>Metopias</i> from the New Red or Lower Trias to the Keuper of Germany.
  <i>Mastodonsaurus</i> from the Trias of England and Germany is the most gigantic Amphibian known,
  with a skull of nearly 1 yard in length.</p>

  <p><i>Labyrinthodon</i> from the Keuper of Warwickshire is one of the latest members of the group.
  Labyrinthodont creatures have also been described from the Trias of South Africa, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Rhytidosteus</i>; those from North America are insufficiently preserved.</p>

  <p>Many of these and allied genera have left their footprints in slabs of Sandstone, both Lower
  and New Red, in Europe, Africa, and America. But although their spoors are common enough, only a
  few can with certainty be referred to Stegocephali, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Saurichnites salamandroides</i>
  of the Lower Red of Germany. The spoors of <i>Chirotherium</i>, common in the New Red of Germany
  and England, for instance in Cheshire, belong to unknown owners; both the large hind feet (which
  measure nearly half a foot in length) and the much smaller fore feet, had five digits, the first
  of which stood off like a thumb. Five-fingered Stegocephali are unknown.</p>

  <p>There is an almost complete absence of fossil Amphibia from the Upper Trias to the Oligocene.
  The Stegocephali as such seem to have died out with the Trias. The recent Amphibia, of course,
  must have had ancestors in the Mesozoic age. There is one little skeleton, from the Wealden of
  Belgium, which belonged to a newt-like creature, called <i>Hylaeobatrachus croyi</i>. Scarce
  fragments, described as <i>Megalotriton</i>, are known from the Oligocene of France, and
  <i>Triton</i> itself seems to be indicated by <span class="pagenum" id="page84"><span
  class="smaller">{84}</span></span>remnants in the Lower Miocene of France and Germany. But fairly
  complete specimens of large creatures, much resembling <i>Cryptobranchus</i>, have been found in
  the Upper Miocene of Oeningen, Canton Solothurn, Switzerland. The first known specimen, now at
  Haarlem, indicating a total length of 3 feet or more, was described and figured in the year 1726
  by Scheuchzer, in a learned dissertation entitled "<i>Homo diluvii testis</i>."</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. APODA or LIMBLESS AMPHIBIA.</b></p>

  <p>The Amphibia Apoda, Coeciliae or Gymnophiona, are a small group of worm-shaped, burrowing
  creatures, restricted to the Neotropical and Palaeotropical regions, excluding Madagascar. They
  have no limbs and no girdles. The tail is extremely short; the vertebrae are pseudo-centrous, and
  most of them carry rather long ribs, none of which, however, meet to form a sternum. The whole
  snake-like body is covered with a smooth and slimy skin which forms numerous transverse folds or
  rings.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable feature of the <b>skull</b> is its solid compactness, which stands in
  direct correlation with the burrowing habits of these creatures. The whole dorsal surface of the
  cranium is practically roofed in by bone, so that, in this respect, it greatly resembles that of
  the Stegocephali; but this resemblance is produced chiefly by a broadening of those bones which
  exist also in the other Lissamphibia, while supratemporals and supra-occipitals are absent.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a pair of bones which represent either the postorbitals or the postfrontals,
  perhaps both, of the Stegocephali. The quadrato-jugal arch is enormously developed, and by
  reaching the parietal, frontal, and postorbito-frontal bones (which latter occur only in
  <i>Ichthyophis</i> and <i>Uraeotyphlus</i>) and the maxilla, extends over the whole of the
  orbito-temporal fossa. The squamosal is completely fused with the quadrato-jugal. The stapes has
  the typical stirrup-shape, is even perforated by an artery, and articulates distally with the
  shaft of the quadrate (as in the snakes). The maxilla is very large and broad. Owing to its broad
  junction with the quadrato-jugal arch, the prefrontal and frontal, the orbital fossa is reduced to
  a very small hole, or the maxilla completely covers the eye. Somewhere between the latter and the
  nares the maxilla is perforated by the tentacular groove. The periotic bones are represented by
  the prootics and epiotics; they fuse with the lateral occipitals and with the parasphenoid. The
  whole <span class="pagenum" id="page86"><span class="smaller">{86}</span></span>orbito-ethmoidal
  region of the primordial skull is also turned into one mass of bone.</p>

  <p>The angular element of the lower jaw forms a thick and large process which projects upwards and
  backwards from the mandibular joint. The former possession of a splenial bone is indicated by the
  occurrence of a second series of teeth in the mandibles of <i>Ichthyophis</i> and
  <i>Uraeotyphlus</i>. Other genera have vestiges of this second row, or it may be completely
  lost.</p>

  <p>The hyoid and branchial apparatus is more primitive than in any other recent Amphibia. In the
  larva the hyoid and the first and second branchial arches are connected with each other by a
  median copular piece. The third branchial arches are free from the rest, but are fused in the
  middle line, the fourth are loosely attached to the previous pair. In the adult both fuse into one
  transverse, curved bar, and the second pair of branchials lose their connexion with the basal
  longitudinal piece and likewise form a transverse bar.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are built upon the pseudocentrous type, are amphicoelous, and the chorda is
  intravertebrally destroyed by cartilage, as in the majority of the Urodela. The number of
  vertebrae is great, amounting in some species to between 200 and 300, of which a few belong to the
  tail. The first vertebra is devoid of an odontoid process. The ribs are proximally bifurcated as
  in the Urodela.</p>

  <p>The eyes are practically useless, being either more or less concealed under the skin, or they
  are covered by the maxillary bones. All Coecilians possess a peculiar tentacular sensory
  apparatus, which consists of a conical flap-shaped or globular soft tentacle, which is lodged in a
  special groove or canal of the maxilla, between the eye and the nose, whence it is frequently
  protruded while the animal is crawling about. These tentacles in the young <i>Siphonops</i> lie,
  according to the Sarasins, quite close to the eyes, but are later transferred nearer to the nose.
  The organ consists of a peculiarly rolled up and pointed fold which arises from the bottom of the
  sac or pit, where it receives a nerve. It is protruded by becoming turgid with blood, and is
  retracted by a strong muscle. Into the lumen of the sac are poured secretions from the large
  orbital (Harderian) gland, to keep the apparatus clean. Hence arose the mistaken <span
  class="pagenum" id="page87"><span class="smaller">{87}</span></span>notion of its being a
  poison-organ. The whole structure is possibly an offshoot of the naso-lacrymal duct.</p>

  <p>The skin is most remarkable. In the ripe embryo the epidermis passes smoothly over the surface.
  Beneath follow two layers of soft cutaneous connective tissue, bound together by transverse or
  vertical lamellae, so that ring-shaped compartments are formed, and in these are embedded
  slime-glands. In the adult each compartment is modified into an anterior glandular belt and a
  posterior space, from the bottom of which grow several scales. The number of cutaneous rings
  agrees originally with that of the vertebrae; but later, and especially in the hinder portion of
  the trunk, each ring breaks up into two or more secondary segments, and these no longer agree with
  those of the skeleton. Each scale is beset with numerous smaller scales which consist of hardened
  cell-secretions infiltrated with calcareous matter. The whole scale is consequently an entirely
  mesodermal product of the deeper layers of the cutis. The usual statement that the skin forms
  imbricating lamellae, on the inner side of which appear the scales, is wrong. The "lamellae" can
  be lifted up only after the general epidermal sheath has been broken artificially in the
  constrictions between the rings. No scales exist in the Indian genus <i>Gegenophis</i> and in the
  American <i>Siphonops</i>, <i>Typhlonectes</i>, and <i>Chthonerpeton</i>, a secondary loss which
  does not indicate relationship. The scales develop late in embryonic life, and they are reasonably
  looked upon as inheritances from the Stegocephali. The glands either produce slime, whose function
  seems to be the keeping clean of the surface of the body, or they are squirt-glands. The latter
  kind are also numerous and are filled with a fluid which is squeezed out by muscular contraction,
  and seems to be poisonous, as it causes sneezing to those who handle or dissect fresh
  specimens.</p>

  <p>The Coecilians live in moist ground and lead a burrowing life. Their developmental history has
  only recently been studied, and in but a few species, see <i>Ichthyophis</i>, <span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page91">91</a></span>, and <i>Hypogeophis</i>, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page92">92</a></span>. The female is fertilised internally, copulation taking place by
  means of eversion of the cloacal walls in the shape of a tube. The spermatozoa possess an
  undulating membrane; the eggs undergo meroblastic division and the embryos have three pairs of
  long external gills. Some are viviparous.</p>

  <p>The snake-like, limbless shape of the body (Fig. 15) is, as in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page88"><span class="smaller">{88}</span></span>snakes, correlated with an asymmetrical
  development of the lungs; the left is reduced, while the right is drawn out into a long
  cylindrical sac. The liver is likewise very long, and partly constricted into a great number of
  lobes. Owing to the great reduction of the ribs progression is effected in an almost
  earthworm-like fashion by the peristaltic motion of the skin, assisted by its numerous ring-shaped
  constrictions.</p>

  <p>The systematic position of the Coeciliae has been, and is still, a controversial matter. The
  Sarasins took up Cope's suggestion, that their nearest allies are the Urodela, especially
  <i>Amphiuma</i>, and they went so far as to look upon <i>Amphiuma</i> as a neotenic form of the
  "Coecilioidea," which they divided into Amphiumidae and Coeciliidae; the Coecilioidea and
  Salamandroidea forming the two sub-orders of the Urodela. They based this startling conclusion
  chiefly upon remarkable resemblances between <i>Amphiuma</i> and <i>Ichthyophis</i>, namely, (1)
  the mode of laying the eggs on land and coiling themselves around them; (2) the existence of
  remnants of a tentacular apparatus in <i>Amphiuma</i>; (3) Cope's statement that <i>Amphiuma</i>
  alone among the Urodela possesses an ethmoid like the Coeciliae. This latter point is, however,
  erroneous; it has since been shown by Davison<a id="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> that
  <i>Amphiuma</i> possesses no ethmoid bone, but that, instead of it, descending plates of the
  frontals join below the premaxilla and function as a nasal septum, with a canal for the olfactory
  nerves.</p>

  <p>We look upon the Apoda with more reason as creatures which of all the Lissamphibia have
  retained most Stegocephalous characters and at the same time form a highly specialised group
  equivalent to the Urodela and the Anura. The following are Stegocephalous inheritances peculiar to
  the Apoda in opposition to the other recent Amphibia: retention of cutaneous scales with
  calcareous incrustations, greatly resembling the scales of the Carboniferous Microsauri;
  occasional retention of post-frontal and lateral nasal or lacrymal bones, and of a second row of
  teeth in the mandible. To these may be added the presence of epiotic bones, and the primitive
  character of the branchial arches. The loss of all these characters would turn the present Apoda
  into limbless Urodela, but this assumption does not justify their inclusion in this Order. The
  possible homology of the tentacular apparatus has been discussed elsewhere, <span class="wnw">p.

  <p><i>Ichthyophis glutinosa</i> extends from the slopes of the Himalayas to Ceylon, the Malay
  islands, and into Siam. A second species, <i>I. monochrous</i>, occurs in Malabar, Malacca,
  Borneo, and Java. <i>I. glutinosa</i> reaches about one foot in length, with a greatest thickness
  of a little more than half an inch. The general colour is dark brown or bluish black, with a
  yellow band along each side of the body.</p>

  <p>This species has been studied extensively by the Sarasins.<a id="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> It breeds in Ceylon after the spring monsoon. The ovarian egg is
  oval, measuring 9 by 6 mm. The yolk is yellow; the blastoderm lies towards one of the poles. The
  strong vitelline membrane becomes surrounded in the oviduct by a dense albuminous membrane, which
  forms twisted chalazae, just like those of birds' eggs, and by these two cords the eggs are strung
  together. Around all this lies another mantle of albumen. The female digs a hole close to the
  surface in moist ground near <span class="pagenum" id="page91"><span
  class="smaller">{91}</span></span>running water, and there lays about two dozen eggs. The
  egg-strings become glued together, entangled into a bunch, and the female coils herself round the
  bunch and remains in that position, probably to protect the eggs against other burrowing
  creatures, as blind snakes (<i>Typhlops</i> and <i>Rhinophis</i>) and certain limbless lizards,
  with which the ground literally swarms. During this kind of incubation the eggs assume a round
  shape, and grow to twice their original size, and the mature embryo weighs four times as much as
  the newly laid egg.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 15.</span>&ndash;<i>Ichthyophis glutinosa</i> &times; 1. (After
      P. and F. Sarasin.) 1, A nearly ripe embryo, with gills, tail-fin, and still with a
      considerable amount of yolk; 2, female guarding her eggs, coiled up in a hole underground; 3,
      a bunch of newly laid eggs; 4, a single egg, enlarged, schematised to show the twisted
      albuminous strings or chalazae within the outer membrane, which surrounds the white of the
      egg.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The external gills are delicately fringed and red, and they move up and down in the fluid of
  the egg. The body of the embryo is at first white, but becomes pigmented with dark grey. A strong
  line of lateral sense-organs is formed, and a ring of them lies around the eye and others on other
  parts of the head. The short tail develops a fin. Of the three pairs of gills the third is the
  shortest, and is generally turned dorsalwards. In embryos of 4 cm. in length the longest gill
  measures as much as 2 cm. Yolk is still present in embryos which have reached the surprising
  length of 7 cm. Then the gills begin to shrink a little, and at this time one pair of gill-clefts
  breaks through at the base of the third external gill.</p>

  <p>When the larvae are hatched the gills are lost. The young larva takes to the water in a
  gill-less state, and moves about like an eel. At the bottom of the gill-hole on each side two
  arches are visible, and there are at this stage neither inner nor <span class="pagenum"
  id="page92"><span class="smaller">{92}</span></span>outer gills. The larvae frequently come up to
  the surface to breathe. The eyes are large and clearly visible, but the tentacles are still
  undeveloped. The epidermal sense-organs are numerous, and appear as white spots in the grey skin;
  about fifty extend from the gill-opening to the tip of the tail.</p>

  <p><i>Ichthyophis</i> seems to live a long time in the larval state. At last the gill-clefts
  close, the tail-fin disappears, and the tentacles come to the surface. The whole skin assumes a
  totally new structure, and the fish-like larva turns into a burrowing, subterranean creature so
  terrestrial that it gets drowned when made to remain in the water.</p>

  <p><i>Hypogeophis.</i>&ndash;According to A. Brauer<a id="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> three species of Coecilians are found in the Seychelles:
  <i>Cryptopsophis multiplicatus</i>, which is rare, <i>Hypogeophis rostratus</i> and <i>H.
  alternans</i>. They live in moist ground, near the coast in swamps, higher up in humus, under
  rotten trees and rocks, down to the depth of one foot. In the island of Silhouette, Brauer found
  them in brooks, at least during the dry season, from May to September. The natives call them "vers
  de terre." They seem to propagate during the greater part of the year, provided there is
  sufficient moisture. The female coils round the eggs, which vary from half a dozen to thirty in
  number, those of <i>H. rostratus</i> measuring 7-8 mm., those of <i>H. alternans</i> only 4-5
  mm.</p>

  <p>The embryos undergo their whole development in the egg. Four pairs of gill-clefts break
  through, the first between the hyoid and the first branchial arch, the fourth between the third
  and fourth branchial arches. There appears also a spiracular cleft between the quadrate and the
  hyoid arch; this cleft is, however, only developed dorsally, and persists for a shorter time. The
  external gills appear at the same time as the clefts, upon the first three branchial arches; the
  third gill is the latest, and remains in a vestigial condition covered up by the two others. The
  gills, of which the second is the longest, are not (as stated by the Sarasins) direct
  prolongations of the gill-arches, but they begin as button-like growths upon the arches. They
  begin to disappear with the absorption of the yolk, getting actually smaller. In embryos of 6 cm.
  they are 6 mm. long, while in embryos of 6.5 cm. they are reduced to 4.5 mm. in length. The <span
  class="pagenum" id="page93"><span class="smaller">{93}</span></span>first to disappear is the
  third gill, of course by being resorbed; and the clefts are closed before the creature leaves the
  egg. <i>Hypogeophis</i> not leading an aquatic larval life possesses no tail-fin in the embryonic
  state, the gill-holes are closed, and the epidermal sensory organs disappear long before the time
  of hatching.</p>

  <p>Vestiges of gills appear also on the hyoid and on the mandibular arch, but on the latter they
  are of very short duration. Those of the hyoid gradually fuse with the first of the branchial
  gills, and these also concentrate with their bases so that they ultimately seem to spring from one
  common stem. Brauer remarks that the distinction between internal and external gills seems to be
  one of degree only; the hyoidean and mandibular gills namely start from the hinder margin of the
  arches, just like the internal gills of <i>Torpedo</i> according to Ziegler, while the other gills
  start from the sides of the branchial arches. He also found a pair of little swellings behind the
  last gill-cleft, and an unpaired swelling (corresponding with a double one in <i>Ichthyophis</i>)
  in front of the vent. Not unreasonably he sees in these swellings the last, very transitional
  vestiges of the paired limbs.</p>

  <p><i>Typhlonectes compressicauda</i> of Guiana and Venezuela is one of the largest Coecilians,
  reaching a length of 18 inches, with a body-diameter of &frac34; inch. The general colour, as in most of
  these creatures, is olive brown to black. A sort of adhesive disc surrounding the vent occurs in
  this genus. Peters, who described this species, found in one female six embryos of comparatively
  enormous size, one of them being 157 mm. (more than 6 inches) long, and 12 mm. thick, and devoid
  of a tail-fin. Instead of lateral gill-openings there is a "bag" on each side 55 mm. long, upon
  which is distributed a blood-vessel. The Sarasins have examined the same specimen: The gills are
  not a bag, but consist of two flat, unbroken membranes which are closely connected with each
  other. In fact the outer gills of all Amphibia may be said to begin in the shape of small bags,
  whence sprout secondarily the gill-fringes; but in <i>Typhlonectes</i> they form these flaps
  instead of growing into the usual three gills. The embryos have no epidermal sense-organs, but
  plenty of skin-glands. Probably when born they take at once to terrestrial life, the flaps are
  possibly shed at birth, and there remains a little cicatrix.</p>

  <p>The recent tailed Amphibia, Salamanders and Newts in the wider sense, have been grouped into
  four families which can be conveniently diagnosed by the following characters:&ndash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>These four families are closely allied to each other, especially the Amphiumidae and the
  Salamandridae.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of the Urodela is essentially Periarctic, except that about one
  dozen species each of <i>Amblystoma</i> and of <i>Spelerpes</i> extend southwards into Central
  America, and in the case of the latter genus even into the Andesian parts of South America.
  <i>Plethodon platense</i> inhabits Argentina.</p>

  <p>The Urodela afford good reasons for dividing the Periarctic region into three co-ordinate
  sub-regions, namely, Nearctic, Eastern and Western Palaearctic. The difference between the
  European and the Eastern Asiatic fauna is well marked; the two are&ndash;at least with our present
  knowledge&ndash;separated by a wide stretch of country very poor in Urodele forms; while, lastly
  <span class="pagenum" id="page95"><span class="smaller">{95}</span></span>there are not a few
  resemblances between this Eastern Asiatic and the American fauna. The Urodela thus lend no support
  to the usual division of the Periarctic into a Palaearctic and a Nearctic sub-region. Nor is it
  possible to divide the Palaearctic into a Eurasian and a Mediterranean province. We have in this
  case to distinguish between an American, an Asiatic, and a European fauna. The Asiatic or Eastern
  Palaearctic sub-region assumes the central position, at least from a merely geographical point of
  view. It would be unjustifiable to assume a spreading from this centre into Europe, and, on the
  other hand, into America. The centre existed more probably in the Arctic circle, now devoid of
  Urodela.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So far as mere numbers of species are concerned the huge Asiatic or Eastern Palaearctic region
  is the poorest, but it is also the least explored, and China will probably yield a good many new
  forms. We know at present only 15 species, nearly all from the eastern half. These 15 species
  represent no less than 11 genera, 8 of which (= 73 per cent) are peculiar to the sub-region. Next
  comes the Western Palaearctic or European sub-region with about 21 recent species of 5 genera, 4
  of which are peculiar. America is by far the richest, with no less than 66 species (36 eastern,
  about 16 western, and the rest Central American, etc.), belonging to 19 genera, 17 of which (= 90
  per cent) are peculiar to the New World. But this richness in species is due mainly to the
  abundance of the two genera <i>Amblystoma</i> and <i>Spelerpes</i>, just as Europe is
  characterised by its many Tritons.</p>

  <p>One of the most striking features of the Asiatic sub-region is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page96"><span class="smaller">{96}</span></span>its difference from the European. They have
  very little in common. <i>Pachytriton</i>, <i>Tylototriton</i>, and two species of <i>Triton</i>
  (<i>T. pyrrhogaster</i> and <i>T. sinensis</i>) are the only Salamandrinae, while all the rest are
  Lechriodont (see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page102">102</a></span>), like the American
  Urodela, excepting the two American Tritons, <i>T. torosus</i> and <i>T. viridescens</i>.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of an <i>Amblystoma</i>, <i>A. persimile</i>, in the mountains of Siam and
  Burmah, is most suggestive, and others will in all probability be found. It must also be borne in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page97"><span class="smaller">{97}</span></span>mind that the
  differences between the genera of Amblystomatinae are in reality very slight; and the same applies
  to the sub-families themselves. The presence or absence of teeth on the parasphenoid, the
  possession of amphi- or opistho-coelous vertebrae, do not mean much, and certainly do not forbid
  the notion that all the recent Urodela are the offspring of one common generalised stock which
  inhabited the northern portion of the globe. Nothing is gained by hiding the solitary European
  species of the essentially American genus <i>Spelerpes</i> under the name of <i>Geotriton</i>. It
  is a <i>Spelerpes</i> in all characteristic points. Speaking broadly, each of the three principal
  sub-families of Salamandridae is characteristic of a sub-region; the Salamandrinae of the Western
  Palaearctic, the Plethodontinae of the American, while the Amblystomatinae are chiefly Asiatic, at
  least so far as diversity of genera is concerned.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Amphiumidae.</b>&ndash;Without gills in the perfect state. The gill-clefts are in a
  vanishing stage, being either reduced to one pair of small holes or being altogether absent. The
  maxillary bones are present. Teeth occur in both jaws; those of the vomers form transverse rows.
  The vertebrae are amphicoelous. The fore-limbs and hind-limbs are present, but small. The small
  eyes are devoid of lids.</p>

  <p>This family is now represented by two genera, with only three species, found in the United
  States and in Eastern Asia.</p>

  <p><i>Cryptobranchus.</i>&ndash;The limbs are functional, with four fingers and five toes. The
  outer digits and the sides of the limbs are bordered with folds of skin. The head and body are
  stout and depressed; the tail is short, laterally compressed, and provided with a fin. The skin is
  very glandular and slimy, and forms a thick, irregularly-shaped fold along the side of the
  body.</p>

  <p><i>C. (Menopoma) alleghaniensis.</i>&ndash;The gill-clefts are normally reduced to one pair,
  individually to the left cleft, the right closing up. There are, however, four branchial arches
  and vessels. The general colour is brown or grey above, sometimes with darker patches, lighter
  below. The "Hellbender" reaches a length of nearly 18 inches (about 46 cm.), is entirely aquatic,
  and is apparently restricted to the rivers and streams of the mountainous districts of the Eastern
  United States. It is very voracious, living on worms and on fish, being much disliked by the
  fishermen, as it takes the angler's bait, and destroys great quantities of the valuable food-fish
  <i>Coregonus albus</i>. Although rather common and easily kept, its larvae still remain
  unknown.</p>

      Japanese Giant Salamander. &times; &#x2159;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page99"><span class="smaller">{99}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>C. japonicus</i> s. <i>maximus</i>.&ndash;The Giant Salamander of Japan differs from its
  American relation in one essential point only, namely, by the absence of gill-openings and of the
  modifications of the branchial apparatus connected therewith. It has but three branchial vessels,
  and the skeletal arches are reduced to two. It lives in Japan and in China, from 600 to 4500 feet
  above the level of the sea, in small streams of mountain-meadows. It feeds upon fishes, Amphibia,
  worms, and insects. It is easily fished with the hook and is eaten by the Japanese.</p>

  <p>The first living specimen was brought to Europe in 1829 by Th. von Siebold, its discoverer. It
  grew within a few years from 1 foot to 3 feet in length, and died in 1881, at least fifty-two
  years old. Another specimen lived in the Hamburg aquarium for fourteen years, during which time it
  is said to have grown 36 cm. (more than 14 inches), having attained a length of nearly 4&frac12; feet, or
  134 cm. The largest specimen known measures 159 cm = 5 feet 3 inches.</p>

  <p>The life-history of this species is still imperfectly known. Japanese picture-books contain
  drawings of the adult and of larvae, the latter showing three pairs of fringed external gills.
  Young specimens of 16 cm. length have already lost the gills, but still retain a cleft on either
  side of the neck, in the shape of a horizontal slit, and this is soon after closed up by the
  skin.</p>

  <p>The best account has recently been given by Sasaki.<a id="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> According to him the Giant Salamander leads a solitary life,
  concealed in dark places, under rocks in swift-flowing, thickly shaded small brooks of clear and
  cold water.</p>

  <p>The animal may be easily captured with a fish-hook, baited with a fish, frog, or several
  earth-worms, and tied to a string a few feet in length. This is thrust by the aid of a small
  bamboo-stick into the salamander's retreat. The string is not tied to the stick, but the point of
  the loaded hook is forced into one end of it, far enough to keep it in place while this end of the
  rod is pushed under the rock. When the bait has been thus brought near the salamander, any bite
  will be instantly felt through the <span class="pagenum" id="page100"><span
  class="smaller">{100}</span></span>rod. The latter is then withdrawn as quietly as possible, the
  hook and bait being left. As soon as a jerk of the string is noticed, a pull is made, which
  generally ends in the capture of the unfortunate animal. If the first pull should fail, the bait
  is replaced as before, and a second opportunity is offered, which the unwary creature accepts as
  readily as the first. The fisherman, having obtained one bite, is sure of ultimate success, as the
  salamander does not learn by experience to refuse the proffered morsel. When captured, it emits a
  peculiar slimy secretion, having an odour much like that of the leaves of the Japan pepper
  (<i>Xanthoxylon peperitum</i>). This secretion hardens into a gelatinous mass after a short
  exposure to the air.</p>

  <p>Temminck and Schlegel state that the act of inspiration is ordinarily performed once every 6-10
  minutes. This is true for specimens kept in tubs; but Sasaki is inclined to think that they
  perform this act less frequently in their native brooks. The eyes are so small that they are
  obviously of little importance; the salamanders capture their prey not by pursuing, but by waiting
  for its near approach, whereupon they seize it with their teeth by a swift lateral movement of the
  head. The eggs are said to be laid in August and September, and they form a string resembling a
  rosary. Each egg floats in a clear fluid, inclosed in a bead-shaped gelatinous envelope, and this
  is connected with the next by means of a comparatively small string. The egg measures about 6 mm.
  by 4 mm., and is yellow everywhere except at the upper pole, where it is whitish. All attempts to
  make <i>Cryptobranchus</i> breed in captivity have failed hitherto, owing no doubt to the
  difficulty of obtaining the cool temperature of its mountain streams. Sasaki's smallest specimens
  measured 19 to 20 cm. These had three pairs of very short branchial processes, from 3 to 5 mm. in
  length, attached just inside the branchial orifice. Each process was somewhat flattened and
  tapering, most of them still with branchlets. In another specimen, 20.5 cm. in length, the gills
  had almost wholly disappeared, but the branchial slits were still visible. One of 24.5 cm. length
  showed no trace of gills, and the branchial orifice was completely closed, but still marked by a
  light streak.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Amphiuma means</i> s. <i>tridactyla</i>.&ndash;The limbs are very much reduced, and end in
  two or three little fingers or toes. Just in front of the fore-limbs lies the pair of small
  gill-clefts, each guarded by two flaps of the skin. There are four branchial arches. The general
  colour of this eel-shaped creature is black, lighter below. The head is covered with numerous
  pores, arranged in several rows, which unite in the region of the neck, so that only two rows
  extend along the sides of the body. It reaches a length of three feet, and lives in swamps or
  muddy waters, for instance in the ditches of rice-fields, burrowing occasionally in the mud,
  feeding on crayfishes, molluscs, small fishes, etc. It is confined to the south-eastern States of
  North America, from Carolina to Mississippi. According to Davison,<a id="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> copulation takes place in May. The rather hard-shelled eggs are
  deposited in the following August or September, and are connected by a twisted cord. The female
  lies about them in a coil. The embryos, which are hatched in the month of November or December,
  have well-developed external gills. By the following February they have <span class="pagenum"
  id="page102"><span class="smaller">{102}</span></span>reached a length of from 68 to 90 mm. (about
  3 inches), living in damp localities under rocks or rooted stumps, and have already lost their
  gills. The legs are said to be relatively longer than they are in the adult.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Salamandridae</b> (Salamanders and Newts).&ndash;Without gills in the perfect state.
  Maxillaries are present. Both jaws are furnished with teeth. The eyes are protected by movable
  lids, except in <i>Typhlotriton</i>. Fore- and hind-limbs present, although sometimes very much
  reduced.</p>

  <p>To this family belong by far the greater number of tailed Amphibia. They have been, for the
  sake of convenience, grouped into four sub-families, the determining characters of which are all
  internal and of comparatively slight importance. Little better is the division into
  <i>Mecodonta</i>, with the teeth of the palate in two longitudinal rows diverging behind and
  inserted upon the inner margins of the two palatine processes, which are much prolonged
  posteriorly, and <i>Lechriodonta</i>, in which the series of palatal teeth are restricted to the
  posterior portion of the vomers and form either transverse or posteriorly converging rows.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Desmognathinae.</b>&ndash;Comprising only three genera, with five species, in
  North America. Five toes.</p>

  <p><i>Desmognathus.</i>&ndash;The tongue is attached along the median line, free behind, oval in
  shape. Three species in the eastern half of the United States. <i>D. fuscus</i> is one of the
  lungless Urodela, for which condition see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page46">46</a></span>.
  The skin is nearly smooth; parotoids prominent, gular fold strongly marked. General colour above,
  brown suffused with pink and grey, sometimes with a dark lateral band; under parts mottled brown.
  The vomerine teeth are frequently absent. Total length, about 4 to 5 inches. They live, carefully
  concealed in the daytime, under <span class="pagenum" id="page103"><span
  class="smaller">{103}</span></span>stones in or on the edge of the banks of little mountain
  streams. The eggs are laid in two long strings, and are wrapped round the body of the female like
  a rosary, the female having resorted to a hollow in the mud, below a stone or other suitable
  place. The outer envelope of each egg tapers out into a short stalk, and the several stalks all
  converge, or are glued together into one common knot, "much like a bunch of toy balloons held in
  the hand of a street vendor." The egg is said to be meroblastic. The larvae seem to remain in the
  egg until they are nearly adult, and they emerge at midsummer, with the gills already much
  reduced. The complete metamorphosis takes place in the autumn of the same year. These little newts
  can, according to Wilder,<a id="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> be collected all the
  year round, in Massachusetts from March to December, except during the time of deep snow. They are
  nocturnal and are easily kept.</p>

  <p><i>Thorius pennatulus</i>, from Orizaba, Mexico, the only species, is noteworthy for its

  <p><i>Spelerpes.</i>&ndash;Except in a few species the limbs are well developed and possess 4
  fingers and 5 toes, which are either free or webbed. But in the Colombian <i>S. parvipes</i>,
  still more in <i>S. lineolus</i> of Orizaba and <i>S. uniformis</i> of Costa Rica the limbs and
  digits are reduced to mere vestiges, and are practically without function, the body, with the
  extremely long tail, having assumed a wormlike shape. The young of many, if not all, species have
  a pair of short balancers below each nostril; in the adult these organs are reduced to little
  swellings or lost completely. Several species are lungless, see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page46">46</a></span>.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of this genus, of which some twenty species are known, is very
  remarkable. The majority live in Mexico and in the United States, a few are found in Colombia and
  Northern Peru (<i>S. altamazonicus</i> and <i>Plethodon platense</i> being the only Urodeles
  hitherto recorded from south of the equator), one in Hayti (<i>S. infuscatus</i>), two (<i>S.
  subpalmatus</i> and <i>S. uniformis</i>) in Costa Rica, and <i>S. fuscus</i> in Europe.</p>

  <p><i>S. bilineatus</i> is a little newt under 4 inches in length&ndash;60-95 mm.&ndash;found in
  the Atlantic States. It is brownish-yellow above, with a black lateral line extending from the eye
  to nearly the end of the tail. The under parts are bright yellow. It lives on land, in damp
  places, concealed during the daytime under stones or old trees, whence it emerges after a rain or
  in the dusk of evening.</p>

  <p>According to H. H. Wilder,<a id="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> "the eggs are
  deposited in May and June in a single layer upon the lower side of submerged stones, each batch
  containing 30 to 50 eggs. The stones which are suitable for this purpose must be in the form of an
  arch, allowing the water to flow beneath. They are generally in the more rapidly flowing portions
  of the brook, but the depth of water must be such that the eggs are at all times entirely
  submerged. They are attached to the stone by gelatinous threads, proceeding from the outer
  envelope, and although they are generally contiguous, they <span class="pagenum"
  id="page105"><span class="smaller">{105}</span></span>are each attached separately." The eggs are
  holoblastic. The larvae hatch early and continue for a long time in the larval state, probably two
  or three years.</p>

  <p><i>S. porphyriticus</i> s. <i>salmoneus.</i>&ndash;Yellowish-brown or purplish-grey above with
  tiny darker dots and markings. The sides of the body are salmon-coloured, with a tinge of yellow.
  The under parts are whitish, turning into salmon-pink on the tail. This beautiful newt reaches
  about 6 inches in length and has a very moist, slimy skin, which, combined with the lively motions
  of the creature, make it as slippery as an eel. It is found in the Alleghany range, from New York
  to Alabama.</p>

  <p>Specimens which I am keeping prefer the wettest part of the cage, where they lie concealed in
  the moss and mud, leaving their hiding-places at night in search of insects. One of them escaped
  into the greenhouse and was discovered after nine months, having established its permanent home in
  a cleft between mossy stones: when the sweepings of a butterfly-net are emptied near its
  hiding-place it peeps out and with a flash of its long, forked, white-coloured tongue it secures
  its prey. Occasionally it goes into a tank, when it swims with rapid, undulating motions, the
  limbs being laid back and remaining inactive; it sometimes rises to the surface to emit and to
  take in air, but, although mostly resting half in the water, upon a rotten stump, it often lies
  for hours at the bottom without stirring. When kept in dry surroundings, the skin soon dries and
  wrinkles, and the animals show every sign of suffocation and general discomfort. The respiration
  of this lungless species by means of rapid movements of the throat is very limited, most of the
  necessary oxidisation of the blood being effected through the skin.</p>

  <p><i>S. fuscus.</i>&ndash;This, the only European species, is thoroughly terrestrial. It is found
  in the mountains bordering the Gulf of Genoa, and in Sardinia. Its total length remains under four
  inches. The smooth, very delicate and easily broken skin is brown above, light below, and speckled
  with lighter and darker markings. Below each nostril is a slight swelling, the remnant of the
  cirri or balancers common to the young of many species. It lives in shady surroundings, under
  stones, in old trees and in limestone-caves, glued to the walls with spread-out toes, belly and
  tail, quietly waiting for insects and spiders which it catches by flashing out the long
  tongue.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page106"><span class="smaller">{106}</span></span></div>

  <p>According to J. Berg,<a id="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> it keeps well in cool,
  moist and well-ventilated places. It lives on flies, small beetles, and maggots; ants are also
  taken at once, probably owing to their lively movements, but a few minutes later the newts roll
  about in spasms and soon die. Towards the end of March one of Berg's specimens gave birth to four
  young, which were 36 mm., or nearly 1&frac12; inches long, and differed from the adult only by their
  exceptionally large nostrils, thereby resembling the Mexican <i>Thorius</i>. The little ones shot

  <p><i>Manculus.</i>&ndash;The two species of this genus live in Carolina and Florida. <i>M.
  quadridigitatus</i> is a very slender, graceful little animal, about 3 inches in length, the long
  and thin tail being considerably larger than the rest of the body. Yellowish, minutely speckled
  with brown above and on the sides, greyish-white below. Life entirely terrestrial.</p>

  <p><i>Plethodon.</i>&ndash;About seven species in North America. This genus has given its name to
  that of the subfamily, which might with more reason be called Spelerpinae.</p>

  <p><i>P. glutinosus</i> is slaty or bluish-black, with small whitish specks, especially on the
  sides of the trunk, where they are large and often confluent. The skin is smooth and shiny. Total
  length about 5 inches, half of which belong to the tail. Holbrook considered this as one of the
  commonest of the North American newts, and mostly widely distributed, from Ohio to the Gulf of
  Mexico. It usually lives concealed under stones, but prefers fallen trees, probably on account of
  the insects upon which it <span class="pagenum" id="page107"><span
  class="smaller">{107}</span></span>preys. When taken in the hand it gives off a great quantity of
  slime.</p>

  <p><i>P. erythronotus</i> extends into Canada and is much smaller. Brown or grey above, mostly
  with a broad, reddish-brown band over the head, back, and tail. The under parts are white, with
  grey and brown specks.</p>

  <p><i>Autodax</i> s. <i>Anaides</i>.&ndash;The large tongue is attached along the median line. The
  jaws are furnished with few, but surprisingly large, knife-shaped teeth, about ten in the upper
  and fewer in the lower jaw. The small teeth of the vomers form a chevron-shaped series behind the
  choanae, those of the parasphenoid stand in one elongated patch. The tail is round; number of
  toes, five. Three species in Western North America, from California to Oregon.</p>

  <p><i>A. lugubris.</i>&ndash;The eyes are very large and prominent. The upper jaw shows a peculiar
  recess on either side for the reception of the large lower teeth. The skin is smooth, devoid of
  parotoid glands, but has a strong gular fold. The upper parts are dark brown or lead-coloured,
  with whitish dots on the sides; under parts white. Total length some 6 inches, about half of which
  belongs to the tail. The fingers and toes are very rich in subcutaneous venous sinuses.</p>

  <p>The habits of these creatures are in many respects peculiar. Van Denburgh<a id="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> says of <i>A. iecanus</i> "that it usually moves quite slowly,
  moving one foot at a time, but is capable of motion surprisingly rapid for a salamander. When
  moving rapidly, it aids the action of its legs by a sinuous movement of its whole body and tail.
  The latter is prehensile. Several individuals, when held with their heads down, coiled their tails
  around my finger, and, when the original hold was released, sustained themselves for some time by
  this means alone. One even raised itself high enough to secure a foothold. This animal's tail is
  also of use in another way. When caught, it will often remain motionless, but if touched, will
  either run a short distance with great speed, or quickly raising its tail and striking it forcibly
  against the surface on which it rests, and accompanying this with a quick motion of its
  hind-limbs, will jump from four to six inches, rising as high as two or three."</p>

  <p>Ritter and Miller<a id="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> have made extensive
  observations on the life-history of <i>A. lugubris</i>. When wishing to pass from the hand to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page108"><span class="smaller">{108}</span></span>the table, the
  creature will frequently execute a well co-ordinated spring and alight on its feet some distance
  away, instead of falling over the edge in the typical salamander-fashion. This species is
  nocturnal and entirely terrestrial, and seems to be indifferent even to proximity to water. Rotten
  stumps and logs are the habitations preferred, and wherever these occur in the region about San
  Francisco Bay, even though at the places remotest from water, specimens are sure to be found.</p>

  <p>The eggs are laid in a hollow under ground, and the female seems to remain curled around them
  until they are hatched, which takes place in two or three weeks. The specimen observed by Ritter
  and Miller laid 19 eggs. Each was contained in a gelatinous capsule 6 mm. in diameter, and was
  firmly anchored to a clump of earth by a narrow peduncle about 8 mm. long. The embryos developed
  very large gills, each being composed of three broad membranous lobes, the latter being thin and
  delicate, much expanded, highly vascular and widely confluent at their bases, so that the gills of
  each side really form one three-lobed mass. Their dorsal surfaces are applied to the inner surface
  of the egg-capsule. The amount of food-yolk is considerable. The whole larval life is passed
  through within the egg. Before the young is hatched the gills wither and cease to be functional,
  and the gill-slits close up. The tail is round, and shows no indication of a fin at any time
  during the larval period. Newly hatched individuals appeared much distressed when put into water,
  and were quite unable to swim. They immediately sank to the bottom and remained there until they
  were removed. The integumentary sense-organs, so well developed in the aquatic larvae of Urodeles,
  are entirely wanting. When hatched the young creature is about 32 mm. long; its general colour is
  blackish-grey, finely sprinkled with bluish-silver. During the second year this garb is changed to
  the dusky brown of the adult, and the fine silver speckling is replaced by much larger and less
  numerous yellow spots.</p>

  <p>Although one of the most terrestrial of Urodeles, this species is lungless, but the skin
  remains delicately smooth and moist throughout life. According to the observers quoted, the
  pharynx plays an important part in respiration. From 120 to 180 or even more vibrations are made
  by the throat in a minute, and in some cases these movements are grouped into series of about
  <span class="pagenum" id="page109"><span class="smaller">{109}</span></span>20 to 25 extremely
  rapid vibrations, with periods between each two series.</p>

  <p><b>Subfam. 3. Amblystomatinae.</b>&ndash;Composed of seven closely allied genera, the
  distinguishing characters of which are the grouping of the palatal teeth and the number of the
  toes, which varies between 4 and 5. The geographical range of the subfamily extends over the whole
  of North America and Mexico and over the whole of Northern Asia, from Kamtchatka and Japan
  westwards to the Ural, and southwards into China. The occurrence of one species, <i>Amblystoma
  persimile</i>, in the mountains of Siam, makes it highly probable that other species and genera
  exist in the hitherto unexplored intervening countries.</p>

    class="wnw">p. <a href="#page110">110</a></span>.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Salamandrella keyserlingi.</i>&ndash;The mode of propagation of this newt-like species has
  been observed by Shitkow near Jekaterinburg in the Ural mountains. The eggs were laid at the end
  of April and were deposited in bags, which were attached to a plant, with one end about an inch
  below the surface of the water. The bag measured 15 cm. in length and 2 cm. in width and contained
  50 to 60 eggs. The larvae were hatched in 14 days in a sunny aquarium; in another with a northern
  <span class="pagenum" id="page110"><span class="smaller">{110}</span></span>aspect the hatching
  took 23 days. The larvae were 10 mm. long, and remarkable for the length (1 mm.) of their
  balancers.</p>

  <p><i>Amblystoma opacum.</i>&ndash;The general shape is very much like that of the European
  Spotted Salamander. The head is short and broad, the snout is rounded. The eyes are very
  prominent, with a black pupil and a dark-grey iris. The neck has a well-marked gular fold. The
  tail is thick and almost round. The hind-limbs are considerably larger than the fore-limbs. The
  general colour of the shiny, moist skin is a purplish-black with light grey, transverse, partly
  confluent bars, giving the creature a pretty appearance; the under parts are paler, bluish-grey.
  Total length between 3 and 4 inches, or 9 cm.</p>

  <p>This beautiful species inhabits many of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, from New
  Jersey to Florida and Texas. In the perfect state it is thoroughly terrestrial and easily kept. My
  specimens prefer the holes of rotten and moist, moss-covered stumps, or holes beneath stones,
  which they leave, at night only, in search of earthworms and insects.</p>

  <p><i>A. talpoideum</i> is closely allied, somewhat stouter and almost uniform brownish-back.
  According to Holbrook, "it chooses light soil in which it will bury itself in a few seconds like a
  mole, and there continue its course concealed from view; but its track can often be followed by
  the elevation produced on the surface of the soil, similar to that seen in fields infested by
  moles."</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>A. punctatum</i> is bluish-black, with a row of roundish yellow spots on each side of the
  body and tail and upon the limbs.</p>

  <p>E. A. Andrews<a id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> has made observations upon the
  breeding of this species. Near Baltimore the eggs are very abundant in March and even in February,
  in small pools in the woods, but the adults are then rarely seen. Even when small pools, but 4
  feet wide and 9 inches deep, were thoroughly raked out <span class="pagenum" id="page111"><span
  class="smaller">{111}</span></span>before and after the eggs appeared, no adults were found, so
  that it is to be inferred that the laying takes place in the night and that the adults leave the
  water every day to conceal themselves under stones. One female was found moving away from a bunch
  of eggs early in the morning. This specimen was kept isolated, and laid many eggs, and as these
  developed into normal larvae, the existence of internal fertilisation was proved. Previously to
  the laying of the eggs white spermatophores were found in the small pools, on the dead twigs and
  leaves covering the bottom.</p>

  <p><i>A. jeffersonianum.</i>&ndash;This very slender and slippery species, reaching a length of 6
  inches, is remarkable for its long fingers and toes, and its rather compressed tail. The general
  colour is brown above, dirty whitish below, generally with numerous, small, light blue and pale
  brown spots on the sides of the neck, body, limbs, and tail. There are several colour-varieties,
  one of them with white specks. It is a very active and surprisingly good climber, easily escaping
  out of high-walled bell-glasses, hiding in the daytime in dark and moist localities. Its range
  extends from Indiana and Virginia to Quebec.</p>

  <p><i>A. persimile.</i>&ndash;This species is remarkable on account of its geographical
  distribution. It is the only non-American species, inhabiting the higher mountains of Siam and
  Upper Burmah. There is no doubt about its belonging to the genus <i>Amblystoma</i>, although it
  had originally been described as a <i>Plethodon</i>. It closely resembles <i>A. jeffersonianum</i>
  in most of its characters, notably in the arrangement of the palatal teeth, general proportions,
  slender toes, and even in the presence of whitish spots, which are scattered over the sides of its
  blackish, smooth skin.</p>

  <p><i>A. tigrinum.</i>&ndash;This, the commonest species, is conspicuous for its large, depressed
  head, which is as broad as it is long, its width being enhanced by the unusually large parotoid
  glands. The mouth is very wide. The large, prominent eyes are golden, and reticulated with brown.
  The gular fold is strong. The limbs are stout, the fingers and toes short. The trunk is strongly
  constricted by twelve intercostal grooves. The tail, which is as long as the rest of the body, is
  somewhat compressed laterally, but bears no trace of a fin. The general colour is more or less
  dark brown or bluish black, marked with numerous yellow spots and large blotches; the under
  surface inclines to <span class="pagenum" id="page112"><span
  class="smaller">{112}</span></span>grey. The length of the adult male is about half a foot; the
  females, as usual being larger, sometimes reach the length of 9 inches. The range is from New York
  to California and to Central Mexico.</p>

  <p>The larva of this species is the famous Axolotl. It is provided with three pairs of delicate
  and much-branched external gills, a flat, long tail with a broad ventral and dorsal fin, the
  latter extending along the back almost to the neck. The limbs, although comparatively slender, are
  fully developed, and the head is much more pointed than it is in the perfect form. The larvae
  usually reach 8 or 9 inches in length; exceptional specimens have been recorded of one foot in
  length, and have been described as <i>Triton ingens</i>.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 22.</span>&ndash;Axolotls or larvae of <i>Amblystoma
      tigrinum</i>. &times; &frac12;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These larvae were found by the Spanish conquerors to occur in great numbers in the lakes near
  Mexico City, and were called Axolotl by the natives, a word signifying "play in the water." They
  were, and are still, eaten, either roasted or boiled, with vinegar or cayenne pepper.</p>

  <p>For many years these creatures were looked upon as a species of the Perennibranchiata, under
  the generic name of <i>Siredon</i> (<i>S. axolotl</i>, <i>s. pisciformis</i>, <i>s. mexicanus</i>,
  etc.), although Cuvier suspected that they were but the larvae of an otherwise unknown terrestrial
  Urodele. The mystery was not cleared up until the year 1865, when some Axolotls which had been
  kept for a year in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, suddenly began <span class="pagenum"
  id="page113"><span class="smaller">{113}</span></span>to pair, and laid eggs which within six
  months developed into full-sized Axolotls. This certainly looked as if these creatures were not
  larvae, but a true Perennibranchiate species. But to the general surprise several of these young
  Axolotls gradually lost their gills, the clefts closed up, the fins of the back and tail
  disappeared, the head became broader, the creatures left the water permanently, and in fact turned
  into the already well-known terrestrial <i>Amblystoma tigrinum</i>. The other brothers and sisters
  of the same brood remained aquatic Axolotls, which thereby revealed themselves after all as the
  larval and not as the perfect stage of this remarkable species.</p>

  <p>At the suggestion of K&ouml;lliker and Weismann, Frl. Marie von Chauvin<a id="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> undertook, at the University of Freiburg, long and carefully
  conducted experiments, showing (1) that little Axolotls can comparatively easily be caused to
  develop further into the perfect <i>Amblystoma</i> if they are induced to breathe air more
  frequently than usual; shallow vessels, perhaps also insufficiently aerated water, will produce
  the desired result; (2) that the commencing metamorphosis can again be checked, the shrinking
  gills then undergoing fresh development; (3) that they can be forced to remain Axolotls; (4) that
  the cutting off of the gills has no influence upon their possible metamorphosis, the gills being
  easily and quickly renewed. The same lady found also that <i>Amblystoma</i>, the perfect form,
  lives in the water during the pairing time and behaves in the same way as the Axolotls.</p>

  <p>The latest observations have been made by Metzdorff.<a id="NtA_55"
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Axolotls, at least those which are kept in captivity in Europe,
  are ready for propagation several times in the year, either in the spring, from April to June, or
  in December. The male deposits spermatophores, which in the following night are taken up by the
  female into the cloaca. On the following day, preferably in the afternoon, she grasps a suitable
  leaf, for instance that of <i>Vallisneria</i>, with the hind-limbs, and presses it against the
  vent. The eggs are expelled by strong wriggling movements of the body, and are formed into three
  or four packets of six to ten eggs each, so that about thirty eggs are laid at one sitting. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page114"><span class="smaller">{114}</span></span>Then she takes a rest before
  proceeding again; the whole process, in which the male takes no further interest, lasting about
  two days. The most suitable temperature is one of 18-20&deg; C., or about 68&deg; F. The water must be
  well aerated. Sterile eggs turn white on the second day. The little larvae are hatched in about a
  fortnight. Eggs which are kept in a higher temperature, from 22-24&deg; C., develop more quickly, but
  the resulting young are smaller; they show already on the fifth day head, tail, and the beginning
  of the gills. According to Bedriaga, they live at first upon Infusoria and <i>Daphnia</i>; when
  they are 20-25 mm. long they eat <i>Tubifex rivulorum</i>; later on they take scraped meat and are
  liable, when hungry, to nibble off each other's gills, but these are easily reproduced. When 20-25
  cm. long, at the age of about six months, they are able to breed. The chief point of interest is
  the fact that this species of <i>Amblystoma</i> frequently remains throughout life in the larval
  state, except that it develops generative organs. The natural causes of this retention are not
  completely known. According to Shufeldt, who observed them under natural conditions near Fort
  Wingate in New Mexico, plenty of food, the drying up of the swamps, and the increasing temperature
  of the diminishing water, hurries on the metamorphosis, while deeper water retards it. Weismann<a
  id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> suggested that the specimens in the Mexican lakes
  which remained Axolotls were prevented from becoming perfect Amblystomas on account of these
  lakes, after the disappearance of the surrounding forests, having receded from their former
  boundaries, which are now covered with a saline, uninhabitable crust. This may be an explanation,
  although Axolotls do not live in brackish water. But Weismann went farther, and with his
  well-known dialectic powers has succeeded in spreading the belief not only that the Axolotl is a
  case of reversion to an ancestral stage, but that the present <i>Amblystoma</i>, instead of being
  the progressive, perfect form, is likewise a case of reversion. A reversion from a reversion! The
  whole line of evolution would then be as follows: <i>Amblystoma</i>; its young, owing to adverse
  circumstances, revert to the stage of the Perennibranchiate ancestors of all Urodela; if some of
  these Axolotls lose their gills and fins, they revert thereby into the original <i>Amblystoma</i>.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page115"><span class="smaller">{115}</span></span>Surely a roundabout
  way of explaining a curious but after all rather simple process of Neoteny; cf. <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page63">63</a></span>.</p>

  <p>Observations on the metamorphosis of <i>Siredon lichenoides</i> into <i>Amblystoma
  mavortium</i> have been made by Marsh, who also gives figures of the larval and adult forms.<a
  id="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 4. Salamandrinae.</b>&ndash;The six genera of this subfamily fall into two natural
  groups: I, True Salamanders, with the palatal teeth arranged in a pair of <span class="sans
  fwb">S</span>-shaped figures, and without a fronto-squamosal arch. II, Tritons, with the palatal
  teeth in the shape of a <span class="sans fwb">&Lambda;</span>, <i>i.e.</i> the right and left
  series meet at an angle; the fronto-squamosal arch is present, either bony, or at least
  ligamentous. <i>Triton cristatus</i> is, however, exceptional, in that the two palatal series
  often do not meet and that the arch is absent. The number of fingers is universally four, that of
  the toes is five except in <i>Salamandrina</i>, which has only four.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of the sub-family, entirely Periarctic, may be said to be the
  reverse of that of the Amblystomatinae. Of the twenty-five species namely, only two are American,
  four are Eastern Asiatic, and of the remaining nineteen, two are Algerian, while the rest live in
  Europe or in Asia Minor. It is in fact an essentially Palaearctic group.</p>

  <p>The six genera can be distinguished as follows:&ndash;</p>

  <p><i>Salamandra.</i>&ndash;Without fronto-squamosal arch. Five toes. Tail round. Three species in
  Europe and Western Asia.</p>

  <p><i>S. maculosa.</i>&ndash;The Spotted or Fire Salamander. General habit stout. Usual length
  about 5 to 6 inches; the females are mostly larger than the males; specimens of more than 8 inches
  in <span class="pagenum" id="page116"><span class="smaller">{116}</span></span>length are giants.
  Head as broad as it is long, snout rounded. Limbs and digits stout and short. The skin is smooth,
  shiny and full of pores, with a strong gular fold. The parotoid glands are large and covered with
  large pores. A series of distinct swellings, or cutaneous glands, each with a distinct opening,
  extends along either side of the back, and a shorter series along the flanks. The general colour
  of the Spotted or Fire-salamander is black, with irregular, large yellow patches on the back and
  limbs. These markings vary extremely, so much so that scarcely two specimens, collected at random,
  are alike. In some the yellow patches form two more or less regular bands, in others they are
  partly confluent; again the yellow may be preponderant on the back or much restricted.
  Occasionally the chrome-yellow is replaced by orange. The under surface is as a rule bluish
  grey-black. This combination of shiny yellow and black is a good instance of warning colours. The
  creature is poisonous, cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page38">38</a></span>. When left in
  peace, or handled gently, it is perfectly harmless, but when treated with violence, or submitted
  to severe pain, a milky white fluid exudes from the glands and is, under violent contractions of
  the muscular skin and body, sometimes squirted out in fine jets to the distance of a foot. Burning
  pain and subsequent inflammation result if this poison gets into the eye. The same applies to the
  mucous lining of the mouth and throat. A few drops of this poison introduced into the blood or
  into the stomach of a small animal are sufficient to cause its death. Cold-blooded animals are as
  susceptible as warm-blooded creatures.</p>

  <p>I once put two American bull-frogs into the same outdoor enclosure with a large number of
  salamanders. Next morning the huge frogs were found dead, each having swallowed a salamander,
  which they were not acquainted with and had taken without suspicion.</p>

  <p>The Fire-salamander has a wide range, namely the whole of Central, Southern, and Western Europe
  with the exception of the British Isles. It extends southwards into Corsica and Algeria, eastwards
  through Asia Minor into Syria. Where it does occur it is rather common, provided the terrain is
  mountainous or hilly and covered with vegetation. There it lives under moss or rotten leaves, in
  the roots of old trees, in the cracks and clefts of the ground, of rocks or of ruins of buildings;
  <span class="pagenum" id="page117"><span class="smaller">{117}</span></span>in default of anything
  better under heaps of stones, or in the holes dug by mice or moles. One chief necessity for its
  happiness is moisture.</p>

  <p>The salamander does not occur everywhere, but is rather local. On certain kinds of limestone it
  is rare or absent; granitic terrain and red sandstone seem to suit it best, for instance the Hartz
  Mountains, Thuringia, and Heidelberg are favourite localities. But even there we may spend days
  and weeks and never come across a single specimen. We may turn stones, rake up the moss and
  leaves, pry into cracks, and we unearth perhaps a few sorry-looking, listless, dull and dry,
  half-emaciated creatures. The same place after a thunderstorm will be literally swarming with
  sleek, lively salamanders, in search of earthworms and all kinds of insects, especially at dusk or
  during the night. They disappear in the autumn, in October, to hibernate in the ground, out of the
  reach of frost, and they reappear again in April. Later on they congregate at little springs,
  always at running water, to reach which they have often to make long migrations. This is the only
  time when these thoroughly terrestrial creatures approach water, in which they easily get
  drowned.</p>

  <p>Although this species is so common its mode of reproduction has been satisfactorily discovered
  only quite recently. There are some puzzling facts which it took a long time to observe correctly
  and to interpret. The larvae are born in April, May, or June, while there are no eggs in the
  oviducts, but in July these are full of fertilised eggs before copulation takes place. This seems
  contradictory. The explanation is as follows. In July there is an amplexus of the sexes, short,
  and often on land&ndash;a sort of preliminary exciting performance. Both sexes then descend into
  the water, but generally remain on land with the fore part of the body. The male deposits a
  spermatophore and the female takes part of this into its cloaca. In the case of a virgin female
  the eggs are fertilised in the oviduct and ripen until the autumn, but the larvae nearly ready for
  birth remain within the uterus until the following May, <i>i.e.</i> about ten months. The mother
  then crawls half into the water, mostly at night, and gives birth to from a few to fifty young,
  fifteen being perhaps the average. The young are surrounded by the egg-membrane, which either
  bursts before or shortly after expulsion. This species is consequently viviparous in the proper
  sense. If she produces a few young only, say from <span class="pagenum" id="page118"><span
  class="smaller">{118}</span></span>two to five, these are much larger and stronger than those of a
  large litter. Occasionally a few addled or only partly developed eggs are also expelled.</p>

  <p>In the case of old females which have produced offspring before, the whole process is more
  complicated. The sperma, taken up in July, remains in the receptaculum of the cloaca until the May
  or June following, <i>i.e.</i> until the previous larvae have passed out of the uterus and are
  born. Then the spermatozoa ascend to the upper ends of the oviducts, where they meet and fertilise
  the new eggs. After these have descended into and filled the uterus, and are already developing
  into embryos, copulation takes place again in July, preparatory for next year's eggs.</p>

  <p>The new-born salamanders have three pairs of long external gills, a long tail furnished with a
  broad dorsal and ventral fin, and four limbs, although these are small. The total length is about
  25 mm. or 1 inch. The general colour is blackish with a pretty metallic golden and greenish
  lustre. The little creatures are very active, and at once eat living or dead animal matter. In
  captivity they are liable to nibble each other's gills and tails. During the first six or eight
  weeks they assume a row of dark spots on the sides; these spots enlarge, and the whole skin
  becomes darker. Yellow spots appear next, first above the eyes and on the thighs, later upon the
  back; the ground-colour at the same time becomes black, until at the beginning of the fourth month
  they look like the parents.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosis is very gradual. The tail-fin diminishes first, but the gills grow until
  shortly before the little creatures leave the water. Darkness, cold, and insufficient food retard
  the metamorphosis, sometimes until October. It is easy to rear them artificially provided they are
  well fed, kept in a light place, and in clean, well aerated water. If prevented from leaving the
  latter, for instance when kept in a glass vessel with vertical walls, or if hindered by a piece of
  gauze from rising to the surface and taking in air, they can be kept as larvae well into the
  winter.</p>

  <p>Very young, perfect little salamanders, of from 1 to 2 inches in length, are excessively rare;
  even specimens of 3 inches are far from common. They probably spend the first two or three years
  of their life in careful seclusion.</p>

  <p>A few adults can be easily kept for many years in shady <span class="pagenum"
  id="page119"><span class="smaller">{119}</span></span>places provided with moss, rotten stumps and
  stones, to afford them suitable moist and cool hiding-places, and they readily take earthworms,
  larvae of beetles, snails, woodlice, etc. But any attempt to keep them in large numbers ends in
  failure. They congregate together in clumps, all making for the same cavity or recess, as if that
  were the only one in existence (very likely they are right in so far as that place is probably the
  best), and they get rapidly enlarging sores, chiefly on the elbows and knees. These are soon
  infested with fungoid growths, and this disease spreads like an epidemic and soon carries them
  off.</p>

  <p><i>S. atra.</i>&ndash;The Alpine Salamander differs from the Spotted Salamander by its uniform
  black colour and smaller size, which averages between 7 and 5 inches. It is restricted to the Alps
  of Europe, from Savoy to Carinthia, at from 2000 to as much as 9000 feet elevation, living with
  predilection near waterfalls, the spray of which keeps the neighbourhood moist, or in mossy walls,
  in the shade of forests near brooks, or under flat stones on northern slopes. The most interesting
  feature of this species is that it produces only two young at a time. These are nourished at the
  expense of the partially developed eggs in the uterus, and they undergo their whole metamorphosis
  before they are born. By far the best and most complete account of this mode of propagation has
  been given by G. Schwalbe.<a id="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> The length of the ripe
  embryos is about 45 mm.; they lie mostly bent up, with their heads and tails turned towards the
  head of the mother. The gills are beautiful, delicate red organs, the first pair being generally
  directed forwards and ventralwards, the second upwards, the third backwards; they are longest when
  the creature is about 32 mm. long, while there is still much yolk present. At this stage the gills
  are so long as to envelop nearly the whole embryo. There is rarely a second embryo in the same
  uterus, and an extra foetus is generally smaller, frequently a monstrosity not fit to live; it is
  probable that it is not used as food, but that it is expelled at parturition. The embryo passes
  through three stages, (1) still enclosed within its follicle and living on its own yolk, (2) free
  within the vitelline mass which is the product of the other eggs, (3) there is no more vitelline
  mass, but the embryo is possessed of gills 10-12 mm. in length, and is still growing. During the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page120"><span class="smaller">{120}</span></span>second stage the yolk
  is directly swallowed by the mouth. The walls of the maternal uterus are rather red. The exchange
  of nutritive fluid takes place through the long external gills, which thereby function in the same
  way as the chorionic villi of the Mammalian egg. Each gill contains a ventral artery and a dorsal
  vein, each of which looks like the midrib of a pinnate leaf; there is also a fine nerve and a weak
  bundle of striped muscular fibres. Each gill-filament receives a capillary artery which extends to
  the epithelium of the tip, where it turns into a capillary vein. The epithelium of these
  filaments, which are full of blood, is ciliated, the resulting current being directed from the
  base towards the tip. In older larvae this ciliation becomes restricted to the tips. The body of
  the gills is furnished with flat epithelium, these non-ciliated portions alone are closely
  appressed to the uterine wall, and it is here that the exchange of gas takes place between mother
  and larva. The nutrition takes place through the gills, as they are bathed by the yolk-mass.</p>

  <p>Schwalbe also explains the whole question of the reduction of the number of embryos. He says
  rightly that in <i>S. maculosa</i>, which gives birth to many young, there are in the oviduct many
  eggs which have only partly developed into embryos, and these, perhaps from want of room and
  nourishment, degenerate into the irregularly shaped whitish-yellow bodies which are occasionally
  found packed in between the developing embryos. Consequently all those eggs had been fertilised
  near the ovaries. <i>S. atra</i> exhibits a further stage in so far as most of the eggs,
  fertilised above in the oviduct, degenerate, and only two or three become fully developed. These
  few embryos live on the degenerating eggs, which together produce the vitelline material spoken of
  above. The two full-grown and metamorphosed embryos, each measuring about 50 mm. in length, are
  equivalent to the numerous new-born larvae of <i>S. maculosa</i>, especially if the smaller size
  of the adult Alpine Salamander is taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>Mlle. von Chauvin<a id="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> has experimented with the
  unborn larvae of this Salamander. She cut out 23 larvae and put them into water. One of them,
  already 43 mm. long, took earthworms on the next day, and the beautiful long, red gills became
  pale and shrunk, and on the third day were cast off close to the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page121"><span class="smaller">{121}</span></span>body. New gills sprouted out on the same
  day, first in the shape of three tiny knobs on either side. After three weeks they had become
  round globes, which gradually sprouted out into several branches, far shorter and more clumsy than
  the original gills. During the whole time the larva was lying quietly at the bottom, in the
  darkest corner, but showed a good appetite. The fin of the tail disappeared and was supplanted by
  a stronger one. In the sixth week the skin was shed in flakes, and this process took fifteen days.
  This larva lived in the water for fourteen weeks and grew to 6 cm. in length! When the new gills
  gradually shrank, the compressed and finny tail assumed a round shape, the skin became darker and
  shinier, and after the larva had again shed its skin, there appeared the dark rugose skin of the
  typical <i>S. atra</i>. The gills were reduced to useless appendages&ndash;not cast off&ndash;and
  the creature crawled out of the water. A fortnight later the gill-clefts were closed. A second
  larva behaved similarly, first casting off the feathery gills, substituting a new and stronger
  set, which, however, fourteen days after excision from the uterus, shrank again, and on the
  nineteenth day the gill-clefts were closed. The lady also observed that nearly ripe larvae, when
  cut out, rushed about in the water and ate, just like the new-born larvae of the Spotted
  Salamander.</p>

  <p>A third species, <i>S. caucasica</i>, is found in the Caucasus. It rather resembles the Spotted
  Salamander in coloration, but has a larger tail and lacks the lateral warts. The male is
  remarkable for the possession of a soft permanent knob or hook at the top of the root of the tail.
  This pommel possibly prevents the slipping off during the amorous amplexus, provided the sexes
  then entwine like certain Tritons.</p>

  <p><i>Chioglossa lusitanica.</i>&ndash;The only species of this genus is restricted to the
  north-western third of the Iberian peninsula. This graceful, slenderly-proportioned and beautiful
  Salamander is apparently very rare and local, having hitherto been found at a few places, namely,
  near Coimbra, Oporto and Coru&ntilde;a. It lives under moss, and runs and climbs with an agility
  surprising in a Urodele. The tongue is long, ending in a fork, and is supported by a median
  pedicle so that the tip can be quickly protruded to the distance of more than an inch. The whole
  length of the animal is about 5 to 6 inches, two-thirds of which belong to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page122"><span class="smaller">{122}</span></span>the long tail, which is compressed at the
  end. The skin is smooth and shiny, with a gular fold and large parotoids. The general colour is a
  rich dark brown, with a pair of broad reddish-golden bands along the back and tail, the bands
  being separated by an almost black vertebral line.</p>

  <p>The few specimens which I have been lucky enough to observe made little holes or passages in
  the moist moss of their cage, peeping out with their heads in wait for little insects, which they
  caught with flash-like quickness. They seem to be crepuscular.</p>

  <p><i>Salamandrina perspicillata.</i>&ndash;This genus, represented by one species, a native of
  Liguria and Northern Italy, possibly extending into Dalmatia, is the only Salamander which has but
  four toes. The skin is not shiny and smooth, but is finely granular and dry, forms no gular fold,
  and is devoid of parotoid glands. The tail is more than half the length of the animal, which
  measures from 3 to 4 inches. The general colour is black-brown with a broad <span class="sans
  fwb">V</span>-shaped orange-yellow mark extending from eye to eye over the occiput. A faint
  irregular yellowish line extends along the middle of the back and tail. The throat is black, with
  a diffused white patch in the middle; the belly is white, with black dots; the anal region, the
  inner sides of the legs and the under side of the tail are carmine-red.</p>

  <p>This slender and pretty Salamander is diurnal, and feigns death when discovered. Only the
  female goes into the water, in March, to glue the eggs on to submerged rocks or water-plants. The
  young finish their metamorphosis by the month of June, and reach full size during the winter, the
  climate of their home being sufficiently genial to make hibernation scarcely necessary.</p>

  <p><i>Triton</i> s. <i>Molge</i>.&ndash;The tail is strongly compressed and frequently has a
  permanent fin. The fronto-squamosal arch is variable, it being either bony as in the South
  European, Eastern and American species, or reduced to a ligament, or lastly absent as in <i>T.
  cristatus</i>. The males of all the English Newts, of <i>T. vittatus</i> and of <i>T.
  marmoratus</i>, develop a high cutaneous crest on the back and tail during the breeding season,
  and this crest acts not only as a swimming organ and ornament, but also as a sensory organ.</p>

  <p>The whole genus comprises some eighteen species, twelve of which are European, although some of
  these extend into Western <span class="pagenum" id="page123"><span
  class="smaller">{123}</span></span>Asia; <i>T. pyrrhogaster</i> and <i>T. sinensis</i> are found
  in N.E. China, the former also in Japan; <i>T. poireti</i> and <i>T. hagenmuelleri</i> live in
  Algeria, and only two, <i>T. torosus</i> and <i>T. viridescens</i>, are North American. Some of
  the species have a limited range; thus <i>T. montanus</i> is confined to Corsica, <i>T.
  rusconii</i> to Sardinia, <i>T. boscai</i> to the north-west of the Iberian peninsula and <i>T.
  asper</i> to the Pyrenees.</p>

  <p>Newts all prefer moisture without heat. During the pairing season they take to the water,
  mostly to stagnant pools, which sometimes implies long migrations. During this period, which is in
  some cases rather prolonged, they become thoroughly aquatic and undergo some important changes.
  The tail-fins are much enlarged; in the males of some species a high cutaneous fold grows out on
  the back, devoid of muscles, but rich in sense-organs. The whole skin, instead of being dry,
  possesses numerous mucous glands and, what is of more importance, specialised sensory apparatuses
  which are arranged chiefly along the lateral lines of the body and part of the tail.</p>

  <p>After the breeding season Newts become terrestrial, hiding in cracks, trees, or in the sandy
  soil. Some species aestivate during the hot and dry season. They hibernate either in the ground,
  or occasionally in ponds. <i>T. vulgaris</i> is difficult to keep in the water beyond the pairing
  season, while this is easily done with <i>T. alpestris</i> and <i>T. cristatus</i>; <i>T.
  waltli</i> can live in the water for years. The food consists of all kinds of insects, centipedes,
  worms, snails, etc., which are searched for chiefly at night. It is astonishing to see a little
  Triton getting hold of and gradually swallowing a wriggling earthworm almost as thick and as long
  as itself. When two newts seize the same worm, as these voracious and jealous creatures often do,
  each gets hold of one end, and swallowing as much as it can, twists and rolls round in a direction
  opposite to that of its rival, until the worm breaks, or until the jaws of the two newts meet and
  the stronger of the two draws it out of the weaker one and swallows the whole worm. They do not
  drink, but soak themselves in the water.</p>

  <p>The skin is shed periodically, and rather often by the rapidly growing young; by the adult,
  during the life in the water, rarely during the sojourn on dry land. The skin breaks round the
  mouth; assisted by the fingers and by contortions of the <span class="pagenum" id="page124"><span
  class="smaller">{124}</span></span>body, it is then slipped backwards over the trunk and tail,
  whereupon the newt seizes the skin with the mouth, draws the shirt off entirely,
  and&ndash;swallows it. Such freshly shed skins are very delicate and pretty objects when suspended
  in water or some preserving fluid. The shed skin, consisting only of the outermost layer of the
  epidermis, is entire, but turned inside out, with fingers and toes complete, the only holes being
  those for the mouth, eyes, and vent.</p>

  <p>None of the Tritons are viviparous. The eggs, which are glued singly or in small numbers on to
  stones or water-plants, are hatched in about a fortnight, sooner or later according to the species
  and the prevailing temperature. The larvae are always provided with three pairs of branched
  external gills; the fore-limbs appear much earlier than the hind-limbs. Most, perhaps all, larvae
  develop two pairs of thread-like protuberances on the sides of the upper jaw, by means of which
  they attach or anchor themselves on to water-plants shortly after they are hatched. Thus moored
  they remain motionless in a slanting position, now and then wriggling their tails and shifting
  their place, or sinking to the bottom. The metamorphosis is finished during the first summer, and
  the little newts, often partially transparent, leave the water to hide under stones. Not
  unfrequently the metamorphosis is retarded and not finished by the autumn. The larvae of <i>T.
  cristatus</i>, especially when reared in ponds with abrupt or overhanging banks, so that they
  cannot leave the water, retain considerable remnants of the gills, still more frequently the
  clefts, although breathing chiefly by the lungs. Such individuals reach a length of 3 inches, and
  are larvae so far as the finny tail and the gills are concerned. They hibernate in this condition,
  and in exceptional cases reach sexual maturity;&ndash;at least the females, which develop ripe
  eggs; the males are not known to produce spermatozoa.</p>

  <p>Much has been written on the amorous games of newts, but it is only recently that the mode of
  fecundation has been actually observed. Gasco<a id="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
  placed the newts in glass vessels suspended from the ceiling of his laboratory. The antics of the
  enamoured male around the female, rubbing the latter with its head, or lashing it gently with the
  tail, and playing around it in its often beautiful nuptial dress, are meant to excite the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page125"><span class="smaller">{125}</span></span>female. The male then at
  intervals emits spermatophores, which sink to the bottom, and the female takes them up into its
  cloaca. For further information see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page54">54</a></span>.</p>

  <p><i>Triton cristatus.</i>&ndash;The Crested Newt has a slightly tubercular skin with distinct
  pores on the head, on the parotoid region and on a line along the side of the trunk. There is a
  strong gular fold. The general colour above is dark or black-brown with an olive tinge,
  interspersed with darker spots; the sides of the body bear irregular white spots. The under parts
  are yellow, almost always with large black spots. The iris is golden yellow.&ndash;The nuptial
  dress of the male is very striking. A high, serrated crest occurs on the head and body; the upper
  surface of the head is marbled with black and white; the under parts are orange-yellow with black
  spots, and the sides of the tail are adorned with a bluish-white band.&ndash;The female, always
  devoid of a crest, generally exhibits a yellow line along the middle of the back.&ndash;The
  average length of fully adult specimens is about 5-6 inches or 13-15 cm.; the females are as usual
  larger than the males; 144 and 162 mm. for an English male and female respectively are exceptional
  records.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Propagation takes place in April. The newly hatched larvae are yellowish-green, with two black
  dorsal bands, and with a whitish edge to the tail-fin. By the middle of July they are about 5 cm.
  long, and the white-margined tail now ends in a <span class="pagenum" id="page126"><span
  class="smaller">{126}</span></span>thread 1 cm. in length. The general colour above is light
  olive-brown, dotted with black; the flanks and belly have a golden shimmer.</p>

  <p>The Crested Newt has a wide distribution, extending from England and Scotland through Central
  Europe into Transcaucasia; the northern limits are Scotland and Southern Sweden. Although found in
  Greece and Lombardy, it does not occur in the Iberian peninsula nor in the South of France, where
  it is represented by the next following species.</p>

  <p><i>Triton marmoratus.</i>&ndash;The Marbled Newt is of the same size as the Crested Newt. Its
  ground colour is grass-green above, brown below, with numerous large and small irregularly shaped
  marbling patches, spots and dots of black. The crest of the neck and trunk is entire, not
  serrated, adorned with dark vertical bands, and separated from the high dorsal fin of the tail by
  a deep indenture or gap. The female has an orange line, slightly sunk in, instead of the crest.
  This newt is confined to France and the Iberian peninsula. In the North of Portugal and in Galicia
  it is frequently seen in little streams and ponds during the months of March and April. The rest
  of the year it spends on land. In France occur hybrids of this species and <i>T. cristatus</i>.
  They have been described as <i>T. blasii</i>.</p>

  <p><i>T. alpestris.</i>&ndash;The Alpine Newt is easily distinguished by the rich orange colour of
  its under parts, which are unspotted, excepting a few dark specks across the throat, below the
  gular fold. Specimens with many ventro-lateral black spots are exceedingly rare. All the upper
  parts are dark, but vary individually. The prettiest specimens are dark purplish grey, with black
  marblings; others incline more towards brown ground-tones, the blackish markings then appearing
  more prominent. The sides are often stippled with tiny whitish dots. The iris is golden
  yellow.&ndash;The nuptial male has a low, not serrated crest, which extends uninterruptedly from
  the nape into the dorsal fin of the tail. The crest is pale yellow, with black vertical bands and
  spots. The ground-colour of the upper parts inclines to blue, especially on the sides. The lower
  fin of the tail assumes an irregular band of bluish-white confluent patches.</p>

  <p>This newt is rather small, females rarely exceeding 100 mm. or 4 inches in length. Its home is
  chiefly the hilly and mountainous parts of Central Europe, from Holland to Lombardy, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page127"><span class="smaller">{127}</span></span>Austria-Hungary, and Greece.
  Although it ascends the Alps to between 6000 and 7000 feet, it is also found in the Netherlands,
  but not in the North German plain.</p>

  <p><i>T. vulgaris</i> (s. <i>taeniatus</i>, s. <i>punctatus</i>).&ndash;The Common or Spotted Newt
  usually reaches 3 inches (7-8 cm.) in length. Boulenger's record-specimen measured 104 mm. It is
  characterised by the yellow, partly orange under surface, which is always spotted with black. The
  upper parts are olive-green or brown, inclining to white on the flanks; the black spots of the
  back, sides, and especially of the tail, are arranged in more or less distinct lines, giving a
  somewhat banded appearance to some females.&ndash;The breeding dress of the male shows a
  non-serrated, but "festooned" high and very wavy crest, which extends from the neck without
  interruption into the likewise wavy tail-fin. The tail is adorned with a lateral, glittering blue
  stripe, interrupted by vertical dark spots. The larvae are marked by a series of yellow dots,
  which extend over the lateral line and the tail, which latter temporarily possesses a terminal
  filament like that of the larvae of <i>T. cristatus</i>.</p>

  <p>The distribution of the Spotted Newt is the same as that of <i>T. cristatus</i>, namely Europe
  with the exception of the Iberian Peninsula, and Western Asia.</p>

  <p><i>T. palmatus</i> s. <i>helveticus</i>.&ndash;This is the smallest of all the European newts,
  rarely reaching more than 3 inches in length. It is distinguished by several specific characters.
  The tail ends in a thread which is in some males 10 mm. in length, but is only just indicated in
  the female. The breeding male develops a cutaneous fold along each side of the back, and a low,
  entire, vertebral crest; the toes are fully webbed. The under parts are pale yellow, inclining to
  orange towards the middle of the belly, and with a few blackish dots. The lower caudal crest has
  its edge blue in the male, orange in the female. The general colour of the smooth skin is
  olive-brown above, with numerous dark spots, which are arranged in more longitudinal streaks on
  the head.</p>

  <p>The Webbed Newt is a native of Western middle Europe, ranging from Great Britain and Northern
  Spain to Switzerland and Western Germany.</p>

  <p>Closely allied to the last species are <i>T. boscai</i> of Spain and Portugal, <i>T.
  italicus</i>, <i>T. montadoni</i> of Moldavia, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page128"><span
  class="smaller">{128}</span></span>beautiful <i>T. vittatus</i> of Asia Minor. From China and
  Japan are known <i>T. pyrrhogaster</i> and <i>T. sinensis</i>.</p>

  <p>The North American species are <i>T. torosus</i> and <i>T. viridescens</i>. The former, of
  Western North America, is one of the largest newts, reaching a length of more than six inches. The
  head is much depressed and broad, and has very prominent parotoid and other glands. The limbs are
  strong, especially in the male. The skin of the upper parts is very granular, uniform dark brown,
  without a crest. The tail, which is larger than the head and body, is strongly compressed, with a
  low dorsal and ventral fin. The under parts and the lower edge of the tail are uniform yellow or
  orange red. The iris is green. A specimen in my keeping spends most of its time in the cracks of
  rotten stumps or on the top of moss in the darkest shade. It lives on earthworms but despises
  insects. Like most of the other newts it becomes lively at dusk.</p>

  <p><i>T. viridescens</i> is common throughout the Northern and Eastern parts of the United States.
  Large females are about 11 cm. long, the males 1 cm. less. The general colour above is brown, with
  a tinge of green; on each side of the trunk, with a row of bright vermilion spots; the under parts
  are orange, studded with small black dots. Half-grown specimens are brownish red, with the same
  lateral red spots as the adult. According to Jordan,<a id="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> this voracious species lives chiefly on the larvae of insects,
  on small molluscs such as <i>Cyclas</i> and <i>Planorbis</i>, on earthworms and on small
  Crustacea. It is eminently aquatic in the adult stage. The eggs are laid from April to June, the
  period lasting for one individual four to six weeks, or even longer. One female laid 108 eggs in
  all from 20th April to 30th May. After having selected a suitable plant, for instance an
  <i>Anacharis</i> or a bunch of <i>Fontinalis</i> leaflets, she bestrides the plant and gathers in
  the surrounding shoots with her hind-limbs, <span class="pagenum" id="page129"><span
  class="smaller">{129}</span></span>pressing the leaves closely around the cloaca. She next turns
  on her side, or occasionally on her back; with fore-limbs outstretched and rigid, with hind-limbs
  and leaves completely hiding the cloaca, she remains perfectly motionless for six to eight
  minutes. Then she slowly leaves the "nest," which now holds an egg well protected by a tangle of
  shoots glued together by the gelatinous secretion poured out of the cloaca. Jordan concludes, from
  the fact that he never found spermatozoa in the oviducts, that the eggs are fertilised just before
  they are expelled, when passing the receptaculum seminis.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosed young pass their life on land under stones and logs as the so-called red
  variety, which is merely a stage in the life-history of the species. It seems to take them several
  years to reach maturity, and to become again typically aquatic. Young, red individuals which I
  have myself kept, have behaved for more than a year like the young of other newts, spending their
  time under moss and bark without going into the water.</p>

  <p>The change from the red-spotted stage has been exhaustively studied by Gage.<a id="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> He remarks that this species is very common near Ithaca, in an
  upland forest and along the head-waters of the Susquehannah. The transformation takes place either
  in the autumn or in the spring, either while the newt is still on land, or after entering the
  water.</p>

  <p>Of two which were kept in a jar with moist wood, one was especially brilliant, but within two
  weeks it assumed, in the middle of September, the characteristic coloration of the viridescent
  form. The two specimens were in the jar until the following July, when they were placed where they
  could enter the water. This they did with great readiness, and they remained submerged for a
  considerable time at first. The time under water increased in length, until within two or three
  days the pharyngeal respiration under water was fully established. On the other hand, viridescent
  specimens never reassume the red garb when kept out of the water.</p>

  <p>Red specimens entering the water in the spring, changed into the greenish form within a few
  weeks, and established the pharyngeal respiration, losing the ciliated oral epithelium. Branchiate
  larvae and the adult aquatic forms have non-ciliated <span class="pagenum" id="page130"><span
  class="smaller">{130}</span></span>epithelium, and the cilia are re-established when a green
  specimen is forced again to live on land. Ciliation always exists in the red stage, and in the
  green stage before the newt has taken to the water. The cilia sweep towards the stomach.</p>

  <p>The three following South European species belong to the <i>Euproctus</i> group, so called on
  account of the mostly conical, backward directed, and vividly coloured vent.</p>

  <p><i>T. asper</i> s. <i>pyrenaeus</i>.&ndash;The Pyrenean newt has hitherto been found only in
  the Pyrenees, for instance in Lac Bleu and Lac d'Oncet, which latter lies about 7000 feet above
  the level of the sea. According to Bedriaga,<a id="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> it
  prefers lakes which are supplied during the whole summer with water from glaciers. It is very
  sluggish, only moving to breathe and when in search of food, which consists of worms and insects.
  The general colour is greenish brown, dark above; the under side of the head and body are bright
  orange red in the female, yellow in the male; dark spots separate this bright colour from the
  flanks. The tail has a narrow ventral stripe of bright red and yellow. The cloaca of the female is
  bright red, that of the male dull grey. The total length amounts to about 4 inches or 10 cm.</p>

  <p>The pairing time is the end of June, or later in cold seasons. The male gets hold of the female
  by forming a noose with its tail round her; it lies underneath, the cloacae being pressed together
  so that the spermatozoa can be taken in directly. The larvae have large yellow-green spots on the
  back and sides, and a bright red ventral tail-fin; when metamorphosed the greenish spots become
  more confluent on the back, producing a broad spinal band. Larvae which live in deep water are
  dark, while those in sunny places are light-coloured and spotted with yellow.</p>

  <p><i>T. montanus</i> in Corsica and <i>T. rusconii</i> in Sardinia are allied forms, but the
  males are distinguished by a spur-like process or dilatation at the end of the fibula.</p>

  <p><i>T. waltli</i>, the Iberian Newt, is olive-brown above, yellowish with blackish markings
  below. The tail has a yellow or orange ventral line. There is no crest. A remarkable peculiarity
  of this species (which it shares only with <i>Tylototriton andersoni</i> of the Loo-Choo Islands)
  is its ribs, which are very long, sharply pointed, and frequently perforate the skin. Before <span
  class="pagenum" id="page131"><span class="smaller">{131}</span></span>perforation the point of the
  rib lies in a lymphatic space. This surprising feature has by many authorities been considered as
  abnormal or pathological. Certainly young, and even many adult, individuals are found in which the
  skin is not perforated, but when these are handled the wriggling motions of this strong newt force
  the points of the ribs through the skin, and they remain sticking out to the extent of several
  millimetres. The wounds heal up, the skin forming a neatly finished-off hole through which the
  spike projects, not as a formidable, but as a sufficiently awkward, protective weapon.</p>

  <p>Large females reach a length of 10 inches. The larvae metamorphose, as a rule, when they are
  between 2 and 3 inches long, but those which have been bred in tanks often reach double this
  length. These newts are frequent inhabitants of the rain-water cisterns common in the South of
  Portugal and Spain, into which they tumble without ever being able to get out again. This species
  spends most of its time in the water, <span class="pagenum" id="page132"><span
  class="smaller">{132}</span></span>preferring ponds, among the vegetation of which they can be
  watched lying motionless, with their limbs hanging down and with the head close to the surface;
  but they are lively during the night. When their ponds dry up they leave them, crawling into the
  most unexpected places, to aestivate under rocks, or even in the walls of old buildings, where
  they are found by accident only. The range extends from Central Spain and Portugal into
  Morocco.</p>

  <p><i>Tylototriton verrucosus</i> lives in the Eastern Himalayas and in the mountains of Yunnan.
  The skin is tubercular, with large parotoids; above uniform black-brown, pale below; the tail has
  a ventral yellow or orange line. Total length about 6 inches. <i>T. andersoni</i> of the Loo-Choo
  Islands is remarkable for the pointed ribs which perforate the skin.</p>

  <p><i>Pachytriton brevipes</i>, discovered in Kiansi, Southern China, has a smooth skin,
  olive-brown above, with many black dots; the under parts are yellowish, dotted with black. Total
  length about 7 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Proteidae.</b>&ndash;The three pairs of fringed external gills persist throughout
  life. Both fore- and hind-limbs are present. The eyes are devoid of lids. The maxillaries are
  absent. Teeth are present on the premaxillaries, on the vomers, and on the mandible. The vertebrae
  are amphicoelous.</p>

  <p>This family consists of only three genera, with one species in each.</p>

  <p><i>Necturus maculatus</i> s. <i>Menobranchus lateralis</i>.&ndash;The eyes are functional,
  being covered by the thin transparent skin. The limbs, although short, are well developed, and
  have four fingers and four toes. The whole animal, which reaches the length of one foot, is quite
  smooth and slimy, brown with irregular dark, blackish spots and patches, which frequently form a
  dark lateral band extending from the mouth to the tail. The latter, which measures about one-third
  of the whole length, is strongly compressed, carries a thick dorsal and ventral fin, and is
  rounded off at the end. The skin of the throat forms a strongly-marked transverse fold. The thick
  stalks of the gills are brown, while the numerous and delicate fringes are dark red in life;
  beneath and behind them are two gill-clefts. <i>N. maculatus</i> is found in the eastern half of
  the United States, chiefly the eastern part of the basin of the Mississippi and the Canadian
  lakes.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page133"><span class="smaller">{133}</span></span></div>

  <p>These creatures are rather dull; they remain mostly at the bottom of the water, more or less
  concealed in the weeds or between rocks during the daytime. Mine, which are kept in a roomy,
  light-coloured tank, lie motionless, with their gills spread out transversely. Every now and then
  the gills contract suddenly and become pale, whereupon they are filled again with blood. Very
  rarely they rise to the surface, but tiny air-bubbles are let out more frequently, especially when
  the animals are disturbed. Then the gills collapse, are laid flat against the neck, and the
  creature darts about with quick, eel-like motions. At night they leave their hiding-places, swim
  about or creep along the ground with slow, undulating movements, the limbs being scarcely used, in
  search of food, which in their wild state consists of rather large Crustacea, small fishes, worms,
  insects and frogs. They are most voracious, and absolutely indifferent to cold. The spawning takes
  place in the months of April and May.</p>

  <p><i>Proteus anguinus.</i>&ndash;The fore- and hind-limbs are fully developed, but possess only
  three fingers and two toes. The eyes are completely hidden beneath the opaque skin. This peculiar
  creature is restricted to the subterranean waters of Carniola, Carinthia, and Dalmatia. The vast
  caves of Adelsberg not far from Trieste are especially celebrated for the occurrence of the "Olm,"
  the German name of this animal. The river Poik, a moderate mountain-stream, but a large, fierce
  torrent during the rainy season, disappears into the limestone-hills, and rushes through enormous
  stalactite-grottoes, most of which have been only partially explored, until several miles farther
  on it reappears on the surface. There, deep down below the surface, in absolute darkness, in an
  almost constant temperature of about 50&deg; F. is the home of <i>Proteus</i>.</p>

  <p>Their total length is scarcely one foot. The whole body is white, occasionally suffused with a
  slight fleshy, rosy tinge, while the three pairs of gill-bunches are carmine-red. They are easily
  kept in captivity, and live for many years, provided three conditions are strictly adhered to,
  viz. fresh and clean water, an equable low temperature of about 50&deg; F. = 10&deg; C. and darkness. The
  question of food is not so very important, since specimens are known to have existed for years,
  although they refused to take any nourishment. How far darkness is an <span class="pagenum"
  id="page134"><span class="smaller">{134}</span></span>absolute necessity is not known. Anyhow, the
  white skin is almost as susceptible to light as is a photographic plate. If light is not
  absolutely excluded the white skin becomes in time cloudy, with grey patches, and if kept exposed
  to stronger light, the whole animal turns ultimately jet-black. Mr. Bles has succeeded in
  producing several totally black specimens, having kept them for several months in a white basin
  under ordinary conditions of light. No experiments have yet been made to find out if the black
  pigment deposited is lost again in darkness. Those which are kept in a tank in an absolutely dark
  cellar of the Cambridge Museum, with permanent water-supply, are doing very well. When approached
  with a candle they become restless or remain partly hidden in all sorts of seemingly most
  uncomfortable attitudes, squeezed in between the sharp-edged tiles and drain-pipes with which
  their lodgings are furnished. But the introduction of a wriggling worm, a little crustacean or
  other live bait draws them from their hiding-places, and, guided by the motions of the prey in the
  water, possibly also by the sense of smell, they snap it up and devour it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If the water is not sufficiently well aerated, they rise to the surface, emit a bubble of air,
  and take a new supply into their lungs. As a rule they remain motionless under water, but the
  gills contract spasmodically and become paler, whereupon they fill again with blood and darken;
  the contrast between the pure white body and the carmine-red feathery gills is very beautiful.</p>

  <p>Until recently the mode of propagation was quite unknown. Several <i>Proteus</i>, kept by E.
  Zeller, laid, in the middle of April, <span class="pagenum" id="page135"><span
  class="smaller">{135}</span></span>a number of eggs which were then fastened singly on to the
  under side of projecting stones in the water. The pale yellow yolk measured 4 mm. in diameter and
  was surrounded by a cover of 1 mm. in thickness, besides an outer gelatinous mantle, so that the
  whole egg measured about 11 mm. The larvae were hatched after 90 days; they were 22 mm. long, and
  already much like the adult, except that the fin was not restricted to the tail, but extended over
  the last quarter of the trunk, and that their eyes were still visible. The fore-limbs were already
  typical in shape, but the hind-limbs were still toe-less little stumps.<a id="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Typhlomolge rathbuni.</i>&ndash;It is of the greatest interest that a subterranean
  Perennibranchiate newt, in many respects closely resembling <i>Proteus</i>, has recently been
  discovered in Texas. There can be no doubt that similar conditions of life have produced these two
  forms from <i>Necturus</i>- and <i>Spelerpes</i>-like ancestors,<a id="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> one in Europe, the other in North America, absolutely
  independently of each other. The limbs of <i>Typhlomolge</i> are long and very slender, the four
  fingers and five toes are thin, free and pointed. The head is large, the mouth square. The eyes
  are completely hidden and the whole animal is colourless and white. The tail is furnished with a
  dorsal and a ventral fin. The very deep gular fold is nothing but the pair of united but large
  opercular flaps. The three pairs of gills are remarkable for their blade-like stalks, while the
  gill-lamellae proper are short and restricted to the tapering ends. Total length about 75 mm., of
  which the head measures 15, the tail 32 mm.</p>

  <p>This peculiar creature inhabits subterranean caves in Texas, to judge from the fact that all
  the specimens hitherto known have come up with the water of an artesian well 188 feet deep, near
  San Marcos. According to Blackford,<a id="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> "the legs are
  used for locomotion and the animals creep along the bottom of the aquarium with a peculiar
  movement, swinging the legs in irregular circles at each step. They climb easily over the rocks
  piled in the aquarium, and hide in the crevices between them. All efforts to induce them to eat
  have been futile, as has also been the case with blind cave-fish in captivity, and they are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page136"><span class="smaller">{136}</span></span>either capable of long fasts
  or live on infusoria in the water." It seems more reasonable to suppose that these newts live upon
  Crustacea, four kinds of which, all new to science, also came up with the water.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Sirenidae.</b>&ndash;The three pairs of fringed external gills persist throughout
  life. The body is eel-like. Hind-limbs are altogether absent, while the fore-limbs are short and
  have three or four fingers. The maxillary bones are absent. With the exception of small teeth on
  the vomer the mouth is toothless, but the jaws are furnished with horny sheaths. The eyes are
  devoid of lids, but shine through the skin.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Sirenidae are the most degraded members of the Urodela and are represented by two
  closely-allied genera, each with one species, in the south-eastern parts of the United States.
  Their most interesting feature, which bears upon the question of neoteny, is their retrograde
  metamorphosis as described by Cope.<a id="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> The gills
  atrophy in the young and are subsequently redeveloped. Cope therefrom concludes rightly that the
  ultimate or persistent gills of <i>Siren</i> are signs of maturity and not a larval character. In
  young specimens of <i>Siren</i> of 5 to 6 inches in length the gills are functionless; in one of 3
  inches they were found to be entirely vestigial and "subepidermal," <i>i.e.</i> covered by a
  common dermal investment. Unfortunately really young larvae are still unknown. Old Sirens can live
  without gills, as has been shown by aquarium-specimens. In the adult <i>Pseudobranchus</i> all the
  gills are normally covered up by an investment of the skin so as to be quite without function and
  movability.</p>

  <p><i>Siren lacertina</i>, the "mud-eel," is distinguished by the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page137"><span class="smaller">{137}</span></span>possession of three pairs of gill-clefts and
  by its four fingers. It reaches a length of 70 cm., or about 2&frac12; feet, of which about one-third is
  taken up by the tail, which is strongly compressed and finned. The skin is smooth, mostly
  blackish, lighter below, sometimes with whitish specks all over the body. This creature is
  frequently found in ditches and ponds, where it burrows in the mud. When swimming the limbs are
  folded back. They are said sometimes to leave the water and to crawl about on the moist
  ground.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>Pseudobranchus striatus</i> has only one pair of gill-clefts and only three
  fingers. The slightly granular skin is dusky brown above, with a broad yellow band on either side
  and with a paler, narrower stripe below. Total length about 7 inches.</p>

  <p>Concerning the evolution of the classification of the Anura, it is interesting to follow the
  changes of the value attached to the various anatomical characters by systematists. At first the
  presence or absence of teeth and of adhesive discs on the fingers and toes were considered to be
  of prime importance for the division of the Phaneroglossa.</p>

  <p>This emendation of the Arcifera and Firmisternia was accepted by Cope in his synopsis of the
  families of Vertebrata (<i>Amer. Natural.</i> xxiii., 1890), except that he still retained his
  suborder Gastrechmia.</p>

  <p>Since the publication of Boulenger's great work a number of forms have been discovered which,
  from the characters of their dentition, have necessitated the establishment of certain new
  families, namely, Ceratobatrachidae and Genyophrynidae; and Boulenger was the first to recognise
  that the taxonomic value of the mere presence or absence of teeth in the jaws had been
  overestimated. I therefore propose using it as a character distinctive of the sub-families only,
  thereby reducing the number of families, relying first (leaving the Aglossa aside) upon the
  firmisternal or arciferous condition of the pectoral arch, secondly upon the dilated or
  cylindrical shape of the sacral diapophyses, thirdly upon the dentition. Blindly consistent
  application of these principles would reduce the Phaneroglossa to four families only, namely
  Ranidae, Engystomatidae, Cystignathidae and a fourth family comprising all the Arcifera with
  dilated sacral diapophyses. This would obviously be wrong. We have therefore to resort to other
  additional characters or rather peculiarities. The opisthocoelous character of the vertebrae and
  the possession of distinct ribs, together with the disc-shaped tongue, separate the Discoglossidae
  and justify their retention as a family. The Hylidae are marked off by the claw-shaped terminal
  phalanges, but the remaining forms, comprising the Bufonidae and Pelobatidae, cannot be separated
  except by their dentition, and I plead guilty of inconsistency in retaining them as separate
  families.</p>

  <p>After all, our classification may not represent the natural system, and it may be nothing but a
  convenient key.</p>

  <p>When we have eliminated the characters of the vertebrae, the dentition, the claw-shaped
  phalanges and the adhesive discs, it may well be asked what characters remain. The firmisternal is
  a further, higher modification of the older, more primitive arciferous condition. The difference
  between the dilated and cylindrical shape of the sacral diapophyses is in not a few cases very
  slight, and there are various, most suggestive exceptions. The presence or absence, size and shape
  of the omosternum and metasternum are of very limited taxonomic value, not always applicable to
  all <span class="pagenum" id="page142"><span class="smaller">{142}</span></span>the members of the
  same family. The fact is, that the Anura are a very recent and a most adaptive, plastic group. The
  earliest known fossils are scarcely older than the Middle Eocene.</p>

  <p>Almost every one of the greater families has produced terrestrial, arboreal, aquatic, and
  burrowing forms. Their habits have modified, and are still shaping their various organs, first of
  course those by which the animals come first and most directly into contact with their
  surroundings (<i>e.g.</i> adhesive discs, dentition, general shape of the body, length of limbs,
  wartiness of the skin, tympanic disc). These are the so-called adaptive characters, sometimes
  decried as merely physiological; as if habits, use, and requirements did not likewise influence
  and ultimately model every other organ (<i>e.g.</i> tympanic cavity, Eustachian tubes, vertebrae,
  ribs, coccyx, pectoral arch, etc.). There are true Toads, Bufonidae, which are as smooth,
  wartless, slender-bodied and long-legged as the most typical of "Frogs"; true Ranidae, like
  <i>Rhacophorus</i>, which by their green colour, large adhesive discs and arboreal habits may well
  put many of the Hylid&aelig; to shame. <i>Ceratohyla</i> has developed the claw-shaped terminal
  phalanges which are otherwise typical of, and peculiar to, the Hylidae, but this genus reveals
  itself by various details as a close relation of the other Hemiphractinae; and these fall in with
  the Cystignathidae on the strength of their cylindrical, not dilated, sacral diapophyses.</p>

  <p>In sketching the phylogenetic tree of the families of the Anura we have to proceed with great
  caution.</p>

  <p>There is not much doubt about the Aglossa. They have retained some of the most primitive
  characters, but have by now been so much modified and specialised that they are to be looked upon
  as an early side-branch.</p>

  <p>Among the Phaneroglossa the Discoglossidae are with certainty the oldest, but are now scarce in
  genera and species, and much specialised. The Pelobatidae connect them with the Bufonidae. The
  Cystignathidae form a rather ill-defined assembly which points downwards to the Pelobatidae,
  upwards to the Hylidae. There is no divergence of opinion about the Ranidae being the highest of
  all the Anura, and amongst them the Raninae the most typical, the Dendrobatinae the most
  specialised. If we assume that moderately dilated sacral diapophyses represent a more primitive
  stage than cylindrical processes, we shall <span class="pagenum" id="page143"><span
  class="smaller">{143}</span></span>naturally look to the Engystomatidae as the connecting link
  between the Ranidae and the Arcifera, through Bufonoid creatures still with teeth in both jaws.
  If, on the other hand, we take the dilatation to be a further development from more or less
  cylindrical processes, then the Ranidae can be considered as having sprung from Cystignathoid
  creatures, which have consolidated their pectoral arch into the firmisternal condition; and in
  this case the Firmisternia would not be a natural group, the Engystomatidae pointing, to the
  Bufonoid stock. This would, to a great extent, mean a reversion to Cope's idea.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Aglossa.</b>&ndash;The two diagnostic peculiarities of the few members of this
  group are: first, the absence of a tongue; secondly, the union of the Eustachian tubes into one
  median pharyngeal opening in the posterior portion of the palate.</p>

      <i>Hymenochirus</i> to be added in Equatorial Africa.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The pharyngeal opening and the tubes themselves are wide, the tympanic cavities are present,
  but the tympanic discs are not distinct from the rest of the skin. The fronto-parietal bones are
  fused into one mass, a rare feature in the Anura. The nasals are large. <i>Pipa</i> and
  <i>Hymenochirus</i> have no teeth, <i>Xenopus</i> has teeth on the upper jaw. The vertebrae are
  opisthocoelous and typically epichordal in their development; the second, third, and fourth carry
  long ribs, which in old specimens fuse with the supporting diapophyses. The sacral diapophyses are
  enormously dilated, and the sacrum is fused with the os coccygeum. The serial number of the sacral
  vertebrae exhibits a most interesting gradation. In <i>Xenopus</i> the ilium is carried by the
  diapophyses of the 9th, in <i>Pipa</i> the 9th and 8th, in <i>Hymenochirus</i> the 7th and 6th. In
  these cases the two diapophyses of each side are fused together into a single broad blade, and
  their original duplicity is indicated only by the <span class="pagenum" id="page144"><span
  class="smaller">{144}</span></span>holes for the spinal nerves. <i>Hymenochirus</i> has
  consequently only 5 presacral vertebrae, the vertebral column being shortened to the greatest
  extent known amongst Vertebrata. For further information see <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page22">22</a></span>. The ilia are much broadened vertically, and are firmly attached to
  the sacrum. The shoulder-girdle is sometimes described as of the arciferous type, but this is
  quite unjustifiable. The epicoracoid cartilages do not overlap each other, but meet, and partly
  fuse in the middle line. The three genera exhibit some differences. In <i>Pipa</i> and
  <i>Hymenochirus</i> the bony portions of the coracoids are much expanded dorsally, and there is a
  considerable amount of epicoracoid cartilage, that of the precoracoid bars extending backwards as
  a broad-based and blunt omosternum. <i>Xenopus</i> is devoid of an omosternum, and the
  configuration of the whole apparatus is more slender. The metasternum of <i>Xenopus</i> and
  <i>Hymenochirus</i> broadens out laterally. <i>Hymenochirus</i> greatly resembles
  <i>Breviceps</i>, a genus of Engystomatinae, in the relative position and size of the various
  parts of the shoulder-girdle and sternum.</p>

  <p>The tibio-fibula of <i>Hymenochirus</i> has a wing-like expansion of thin bone on each side,
  forming a deep groove on the outer aspect. The astragalus and calcaneum are united by a similar
  bony expansion with wing-like projections.</p>

  <p>The lungs are remarkable for the prominent development of trabecular projections and niches, so
  that their free lumen is much restricted; they have thereby reached a much higher stage than in
  any other Amphibia or even many Autosauri. The persistence of an arteria sacralis s. caudalis, a
  vessel absolutely absent in the adult <i>Rana</i>, is a primitive feature, and the same applies to
  the presence of a true first spinal or suboccipital nerve.</p>

  <p>The skin of the back and belly is supplied by two great branches from the arteria anonyma, one
  arising proximally, the other distally from the subclavian; herewith is correlated the almost
  complete absence of the arteria cutanea magna, which as a branch of the ductus pulmo-cutaneus
  plays such a prominent r&ocirc;le in the other Anura. Only in <i>Pipa</i>, but not in <i>Xenopus</i>, is
  the great cutaneous vein represented by a very small branch. Both these genera possess a much more
  complicated "diaphragm" than the other Anura, chiefly owing to a special muscle which arises <span
  class="pagenum" id="page145"><span class="smaller">{145}</span></span>from the anterior end of the
  ilia and spreads out fan-like to the oesophagus and to the bases of the lungs.<a id="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> This diaphragmatic arrangement is correlated with the great
  development of the lungs, and is not a primitive but an advanced feature. It is reasonable to
  suppose that this has caused the reduction of the usual arteria pulmo-cutanea, and that the other
  two cutaneous arteries have been developed secondarily. The Aglossa are generally considered as
  the lowest Anura, and only Cope looked upon <i>Pipa</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> as two convergent
  terminal branches. Beddard came to the conclusion that both are closely related to each other,
  chiefly on account of their peculiar diaphragmatic arrangement. The whole question has entered
  upon a new stage since the recent discovery of <i>Hymenochirus</i>, which is in many ways
  intermediate between the two other genera. Moreover, the mid-Tertiary <i>Palaeobatrachus</i> of
  Europe is undoubtedly related to them, and we conclude now that all these four genera belong to
  one group with a distribution formerly much wider than Africa and part of South America. But this
  does not necessarily mean that the Aglossa are in all respects the most primitive group of living
  Anura. On the contrary, they possess few decidedly primitive characters, namely, the long typical
  ribs, the presence of the first spinal nerve, the unimportant persistence of the arteria sacralis,
  and lastly, the possession in the tadpoles of a right and left opercular "spiracle." The absence
  of the tongue cannot possibly be an archaic feature, considering its universal presence in all the
  other Amphibia, including the Apoda, and the suggestive circumstance that this organ is least
  developed in the entirely aquatic members of the Urodela. In fact, thoroughly aquatic creatures,
  which seize and swallow their prey under water, require no elaborate tongue; and since we know
  that the Anura must owe their typical formation to terrestrial life, it follows that those which
  have again taken to the water and are tongueless, have lost this organ. As I have shown
  elsewhere,<a id="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> the epichordal development of the
  vertebrae is likewise a secondary feature, far from primitive; and the tendency of the shortening
  of the vertebral column, which has reached its extreme in <i>Hymenochirus</i>, points to the same
  conclusion. The apparatus of the shoulder-girdle and sternum is in the last transitional stage
  from the former arciferous to the typically consolidated firmisternal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page146"><span class="smaller">{146}</span></span>type. In fact there is little left which is
  primitive, but much that is very specialised and highly developed in the Aglossa, mostly in
  adaptation to their absolutely aquatic life, to which they must however have taken very early.
  They are in a position somewhat analogous to the Ratitae among Birds, which are likewise an old
  group, although many of their most striking features have been acquired secondarily.</p>

  <p><i>Xenopus</i> s. <i>Dactylethra</i>. The upper jaw is furnished with teeth. The ilia are
  attached to the ninth vertebra. The pupil is round. The terminal phalanges are pointed. The
  fingers are free, the toes broadly webbed, and the first three are covered with sharply pointed,
  horny, black-brown nails, a feature which is alluded to by the alternative generic names. A
  cutaneous tentacle projects from below the eye and naturally invites comparison with the tentacle
  of the Apoda and of Urodela. The skin is smooth, rich in mucous glands, besides certain tube-like
  apparatuses, possibly sensory, which are scattered over the body, especially on the head, and form
  a conspicuous series of white dots along the dorso-lateral line, from the eye to the vent. The
  general colour of the upper parts is olive brown, mottled darker, while the under parts are
  whitish. The female has three cutaneous flaps closing the vent. The male develops black nuptial
  brushes along the inner side of the fingers. There are several species, all African
  (Ethiopian).</p>

  <p><i>X. laevis</i>, ranging from the Cape to Abyssinia, is distinguished by the absence of a
  metatarsal spur. The tentacle is very short. Size about 3 inches. <i>X. muelleri</i> of Zanzibar
  and Benguella, is smaller. The tentacle is conspicuous, as long as the diameter of the eye. The
  inner metatarsal tubercle carries a sharp claw. <i>X. calcaratus</i> of tropical West Africa is
  only 2 inches long, and has strong metatarsal claws, short tentacles and very minute eyes.</p>

  <p>The habits and oviposition of the "Clawed Toad" have been described by Leslie.<a id="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> The Boers call it "Plathander," <i>i.e.</i> flat hand. Entirely
  aquatic, it rests floating in the water, with the nostrils exposed, and leaves the water only if
  it has to change the locality on account of drought or scarcity of food. The pairing takes place,
  at least at Port Elizabeth, in the early spring, <i>i.e.</i> in the month of August. The only
  sound which is emitted is heard during this time, a very slight and dull tick-tick, audible at
  only a few feet distance. The male grasps the female by the loins; the eggs are extruded singly,
  measuring only 1.5 mm. in diameter, but swell to double that size. They are attached singly to
  stones or water-plants.</p>

  <p>Latterly these creatures have frequently been brought over to England. They stand confinement
  very well, even in a little aquarium with sufficient water-weeds to keep the water fresh; and they
  do not require special heat. They greedily snap up worms, strips of liver, or meat, and poke the
  food in with their hands. A few kept by Boulenger in a glass jar have lived for the last eleven
  years in the ordinary temperature of a room in London. Curiously enough they are often in amorous
  embrace, regardless of the season, but they have never shown any signs of spawning.</p>

  <p>Some of those in the Zoological Gardens in London laid eggs on Saturday the 27th of May, and on
  the morning of the following Monday the larvae were already hatched. They have been described by
  Beddard.<a id="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> The larvae are provided with an unpaired
  circular, ventral sucker. The tentacles begin to sprout out on the sixth day after hatching, at
  first not in connexion with the cranial cartilage, but soon a cartilaginous rod runs into the
  tentacle from the ethmoid "just above the joint with the under jaw.". Boulenger has most
  reasonably compared these organs with the "balancers" of <i>Triton</i> and <i>Amitystoma</i> (cf.
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page46">46</a></span> for the possible homologies of the
  balancers). The tentacles soon reach a great length and give the tadpole a curious appearance. In
  tadpoles of <i>X. calcaratus</i>, 65 mm. long, the tentacles are 30 mm. long, and are inserted
  just at the angle of the mouth. By the time that these tadpoles show their fore-limbs, the feelers
  are reduced to 4 mm. in length, and their relative position has been shifted to a little above the
  angle of the gape, and whilst the latter gradually extends further and further back, the feelers
  come to lie, or rather remain, below and a little in front of the eyes.</p>

  <p>The tadpoles have no traces of horny teeth. External gills project as low conical or lamellar
  processes from the first three branchial arches, but so-called internal gills are not
  developed.</p>

  <p>Amongst a number of Clawed Toads imported in the spring one female became swollen with eggs,
  but as they did not show signs of wanting to breed, a pair was put into the tropical tank <span
  class="pagenum" id="page149"><span class="smaller">{149}</span></span>in the Cambridge Botanic
  Gardens, a transfer which had the desired effect. Eggs were laid, and more during the following
  nights; they hatched out within thirty hours. The whole brood was lost, before any of them were
  older than a few days, since they were attacked, beyond the possibility of a cure, by a
  <i>Saprolegnia</i> or some similar pest.</p>

  <p><i>Hymenochirus</i>, represented by one species, <i>H. boettgeri</i>, has been discovered in
  the Ituri, German East Africa, and in the French Congo, and has no doubt a much wider
  distribution. It is scarcely 1&frac12; inch long, and is easily recognised by the toothless mouth, the
  half-webbed fingers (hence the generic name), the incompletely webbed toes, the third of which is
  longer than the fourth, and the absence of sensory muciferous canals in the skin. The three inner
  toes are, as in <i>Xenopus</i>, furnished with small black claws. The skin is rough, beset with
  small granular tubercles. The general colour above and below is olive-brown. The vent is, as in
  <i>Xenopus</i>, produced into a spout or semi-canal, but is devoid of dorsal flaps of skin.</p>

  <p><i>Pipa.</i>&ndash;This Neotropical member of the Aglossa is quite toothless, but the jaws of
  the adult have horny substitutes. The only species is <i>P. americana</i>, the famous Surinam
  Toad, chiefly known from the Guianas, but undoubtedly extending much further, having recently been
  reported from the neighbourhood of Par&aacute;.</p>

  <p>The general shape of this creature is very peculiar. The head is much depressed and triangular;
  the eyes are very small; the skin forms several short, irregularly-shaped flaps and tentacles on
  the upper lips and in front of the eye, and at the angle of the mouth. The tympanum is invisible.
  The pupil is round. The fingers are very slender and free, ending in star-shaped tips; the toes
  are broadly webbed. The whole skin is covered with small tubercles and is dark brown above, while
  the under parts of the very flat and depressed body are whitish, sometimes with a dark brown
  stripe along the middle line. In the female the skin of the back forms growths for the reception
  of the eggs, and in these the young undergo their whole metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>The most characteristic feature of the skin,<a id="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
  which has exactly the same structure in both sexes, is the papillae, which are spread over the
  whole surface, except on the webs of the toes, on the cornea and on the star-shaped points of the
  fingers. Each papilla carries a little horny spike, and a poison-gland frequently opens near its
  base. Larger poison-glands exist on the dorsal and ventral side in four rows, and smaller glands
  open upon the sides of the body, but there are no parotoid complexes. Slime-glands occur all over
  the surface. The epidermis consists of the usual layers, namely the Malpighian, the stratum
  corneum, and the part which is shed periodically. The latter is completely horny, appearing to be
  structureless like a cuticle, but it is in reality composed of polygonal cells with flattened
  nuclei; each little spike is one modified horny cell. The whole outermost layer contains
  black-brown pigment. The upper portion of the cutis is devoid of pigment, then follows a layer of
  clusters of ramified dark pigment-cells, and lastly the rest of the cutis.</p>

  <p>Each of the four fingers ends in a four-armed star, the tips of which again carry four or five
  sensory papillae. The cartilage of the terminal phalanges is correspondingly star-shaped.</p>

  <p>According to Klinckowstroem these toads, which are entirely aquatic, are easily collected at
  the end of the long dry period, when they are all confined to the half-dried-up pools. But they do
  not spawn there. This happens after the rains have inundated the forest, and then it is very
  difficult to get the females with eggs on their backs. Each of the eggs, when once they have been
  glued on to the back, sinks into an invagination of the skin. The initial stages are probably the
  same as those caused by the eggs on the belly of <i>Rhacophorus reticulatus</i> (see <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page248">248</a></span>). Later, each egg is quite concealed in a cavity
  with a lid. These cavities are simply pouches of the skin, and are not formed by enlarged glands
  as has been suggested by some anatomists. Each cavity consists of the epidermal pouch and the lid.
  How the latter is produced is not known. According to the authors quoted above, the lid looks like
  a shiny or sticky layer which has hardened into horn-like consistency. It lies exactly like a lid
  upon the rim of the pouch itself, and is certainly not in structural or organic continuity with
  the epidermis. Most probably it is produced by the remnant of the egg-shell itself, which, after
  the larva is hatched, is cast up to and remains on the top of the cup.</p>

  <p>Bartlett<a id="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> has described the spawning of
  specimens in the Zoological Gardens in London.</p>

  <p>"About the 28th of April 1896 the males became very lively, and were constantly heard uttering
  their most remarkable metallic, ticking call-notes. On examination we then observed two of the
  males clasping tightly round the lower part of the bodies of the females, the hind parts of the
  males extending beyond those of the females. On the following morning the keeper arrived in time
  to witness the mode in which the eggs were deposited. The oviduct of the female protruded from her
  body more than an inch in length, and the bladder-like protrusion being retroverted, passed under
  the belly of the male on to her own back. The male appeared to press tightly upon this protruded
  bag and to squeeze it from side to side, apparently pressing the eggs forward one by one on to the
  back of the female. By this movement the eggs were spread with nearly uniform smoothness over the
  whole surface of the back of the female to which they became firmly adherent. On the operation
  being completed, the males left their places on the females, and the enlarged and projected
  oviduct gradually disappeared from one of the females. In the other specimen, the oviduct appears
  not to have discharged the whole of the eggs."</p>

  <p>Boulenger, who examined this second specimen, which died, confirmed this egg-bound condition.
  He remarks further: "The ovipositor formed by the cloaca (not by the prolapsed uterus), was still
  protruding and much inflamed. It may be deduced from the observation made by the keeper, that
  fecundation must take place before the extrusion of the eggs, and it is probable that the
  ovipositor serves in the first instance to collect the spermatozoa which would penetrate into the
  oviducts, the eggs being laid in the impregnated condition, as in tailed Batrachians."</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Phaneroglossa&ndash;Fam. 1. Discoglossidae.</b>&ndash;The tongue has the shape
  of a round disc, adherent by nearly the whole of its base, and it cannot be protruded. The
  vertebrae are opisthocoelous, and in the aquatic genera are of the most exaggerated epichordal
  type; the diapophyses of the second to the fourth vertebrae carry short, free ribs, and those of
  the sacral vertebra are dilated. The metasternum behind is forked. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page153"><span class="smaller">{153}</span></span>upper jaw and the vomers are provided with
  teeth. The males have no vocal sac. The tadpoles are distinguished by having the opercular
  spiracle placed in the middle of the thoracic region (see general anatomical part, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page44">44</a></span>).</p>

  <p>The few members of this family have a peculiar distribution. <i>Liopelma</i> is confined to New
  Zealand, where it is the solitary representative of the Amphibia. <i>Ascaphus</i> is found in
  North America. The other genera, <i>Discoglossus</i>, <i>Bombinator</i>, and <i>Alytes</i>, are
  typical of the Palaearctic sub-region, and are, with the exception of <i>Bombinator</i>, confined
  to the Western Provinces (cf. Map, Fig. 32, on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page161">161</a></span>).</p>

  <p><i>Discoglossus.</i>&ndash;The tympanum is frequently more or less concealed by the skin. The
  pupil is round or triangular. The omosternum is small. The vertebrae are of the epichordal
  type.</p>

  <p><i>D. pictus</i>, the only species, has a smooth and shiny skin, provided with numerous small
  mucous glands. The palms of the hands are provided with three tubercles, of which the innermost is
  the largest, and is carried by the vestige of the thumb. The coloration of this species is very
  variable. The ground-colour of the upper parts is a rich olive brown with darker, light-edged
  patches, which are either separate or confluent in various ways, forming broad, longitudinal
  bands, or a few larger asymmetrical patches, separated in some individuals by a broad and
  conspicuous light brown or yellowish vertebral stripe. An irregular reddish band frequently
  extends from the eyes backwards along the sides. The under parts are mostly yellowish white. This
  variability is purely individual, the most differently marked and variously coloured specimens
  being found in the same locality and even amongst the members of one and the same brood. The male
  develops various nuptial excrescences, consisting of minute, dark, horny spines, notably on the
  inner palmar pad, on the inner side of the first and second finger, on the chin and throat, and
  smaller and more scattered spicules on the belly and legs.</p>

  <p>This pretty and extremely active little creature, which measures between 2 and 3 inches in
  length, is confined to the south-western corner of the Palaearctic sub-region, being found in
  Algiers and Morocco, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the southern and western parts of the Iberian
  Peninsula. Curiously <span class="pagenum" id="page154"><span
  class="smaller">{154}</span></span>enough it is absent in the Balearic Isles. Rather aquatic in
  its habits, frequenting pools and streams, it is also often found on land.</p>

  <p>The male has a feeble voice, which sounds like "ha-a, ha-a-a," or "wa-wa-wa," uttered in rapid
  succession. The pairing season lasts a long time, in Algeria from January to October, but a much
  shorter time in the north of Portugal, where it extends over the spring and summer months.
  Boulenger has made extensive observations on many specimens kept in captivity. The embrace, which
  never lasts long, is lumbar. The eggs are small, 1 to 1.5 mm. in diameter, dark brown above and
  greyish below, each surrounded by a gelatinous capsule of 3-7 mm. in diameter. The eggs are laid
  singly, and a set amounts to from 300 to 1000, the whole mass sinking to the bottom of the pool.
  Each female lays several times during the season. The eggs are developed very rapidly, the larvae
  escaping sometimes after thirty-six hours, but usually from the second to the fourth day. The
  external gills are lost on the seventh day, when the tadpoles are 11 mm. long; the hind-limbs
  appear on the tenth, and after four weeks the tadpoles reach their greatest length, namely from
  25-30 mm. The fore-limbs appear on the thirtieth day, and a few days later the most precocious
  specimens leave the water and hop about. Others, however, of the same brood took from two to three
  months in metamorphosing.</p>

  <p>This species lives on insects and worms, and can swallow its prey under water.</p>

  <p><i>Bombinator.</i>&ndash;The tympanum is absent and the Eustachian tubes are very minute. The
  pupil is triangular. The omosternum is absent. The vertebrae are absolutely epichordal. The
  fingers are free, the toes are webbed. The upper parts are uniformly dark, and are covered with
  small porous warts. The general shape of the head and body is depressed or flattened downwards.
  The habits are eminently aquatic. This genus consists of three species, two of which are European,
  the third Chinese.</p>

  <p><i>B. igneus.</i>&ndash;The under parts are conspicuously coloured bluish black with large
  irregular red or orange-red patches; the upper parts are more or less dark grey or olive black.
  The iris is golden, speckled with brown. The male has a pair of internal vocal sacs by which the
  throat can be inflated; nuptial excrescences are developed on the inner side of the fore-arm and
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span class="smaller">{155}</span></span>first two fingers.
  Total length from 1&frac12; to 2 inches, the males being generally smaller than the females. This
  "Fire-bellied toad," the "Unke" of the Germans, is essentially a native of lakes, ponds, and other
  standing waters of the plains.</p>

  <p>It ranges through the whole of North Germany, Bohemia, and Hungary into Russia, eastwards as
  far as the Volga. The latter river, the Danube, and the Weser form, roughly speaking, its
  boundaries; northwards it extends into Denmark and the southern extremity of Sweden.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>B. pachypus.</i>&ndash;The under parts are yellow instead of red. The male is devoid of
  vocal sacs, but has nuptial excrescences on the under surface of most of the toes, in addition to
  those on the fore-arm and fingers. The "Yellow-bellied Toad" is the representative of the
  red-bellied species in Southern and Western Europe, preferring, although not exclusively, the
  hilly and mountainous districts. It ranges from France and Belgium through South-Western Germany,
  continental Italy, and the whole of Austria and Turkey in Europe. Where both species meet, for
  instance in the hilly districts between the Weser and the Rhine, in Thuringia and in Austria, the
  predilection of the yellow-bellied <span class="pagenum" id="page156"><span
  class="smaller">{156}</span></span>species for the hills, and that of the other for the plains, is
  well marked.</p>

  <p>While <i>B. igneus</i> prefers standing waters with plenty of vegetation, <i>B. pachypus</i> is
  often found in the smallest occasional puddles produced by recent rain, for instance in the ruts
  of roads. Both species have otherwise much in common. They are essentially aquatic. They hang in
  the water, with their legs extended, nose and eyes just above the surface, and bask or lie in wait
  for passing insects, the fire-bellied kind preferring to conceal itself in the vegetation of the
  margins of ponds. During the pairing season, in Germany in the month of May, they are very lively
  and perform peculiar concerts, one male beginning with a slowly repeated note like "hoonk, hoonk,"
  or "ooh, ooh," in which all the other males soon join, so that, when there are many, an almost
  continuous music is produced. This sound is not at all loud, a little mournful and very deceptive.
  It appears to be a long way off, certainly at the other end of the pond, until by careful watching
  you see the little creature almost at your very feet. But on the slightest disturbance the
  performance ceases, they dive below and hide at the bottom. The yellow-bellied kind, when
  surprised in a shallow puddle, skims over the mud, disturbs it, and allows it to settle upon its
  flat body, so that nothing but the little glittering eyes will betray its concealment. When these
  toads are surprised on land, or roughly touched, they assume a most peculiar attitude, as shown in
  Fig. 31. The head is partly thrown back, the limbs are turned upwards with their under surfaces
  outwards, and the whole body is curved up so that as much as possible of the bright yellow or red
  markings of the under parts is exposed to view. The creature remains in this strained position
  until all danger seems passed. In reality this is an exhibition of warning colours, to show the
  enemy what a dangerous animal he would have to deal with. The secretion of the skin is very
  poisonous, and the fire-toads are thereby well protected. I know of no creature which will eat or
  even harm them. I have kept numbers in a large vivarium, together with various snakes,
  water-tortoises, and crocodiles, but for years the little fire-bellies remained unmolested,
  although they shared a pond in which no other frog or newt could live without being eaten. Hungry
  water-tortoises stalk them under water, touch the intended prey with the nose in order to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page157"><span class="smaller">{157}</span></span>get the right scent, and
  then they withdraw from the <i>Bombinator</i>, which has remained motionless, well knowing that
  quick movements, or a show of escape, would most likely induce the tortoise to a hasty snap, with
  consequences to be regretted by both.</p>

  <p>After they have been handled frequently, they do not readily perform, but simply lie still, or
  hop away. Miss Durham experienced considerable difficulty in inducing her tame specimens to assume
  and to keep up the correct warning attitude. The statement that they "turn over on the back" is a
  fable, graphically fixed in various illustrated works.</p>

  <p>It has been said that these two species are diurnal and thoroughly aquatic. They are certainly
  active in the daytime, sing in full sunshine, and spend most of their time in the water, but they
  display much more liveliness towards the evening and during the night, especially when there is a
  moon. My fire-toads live by no means always in the water, but conceal themselves in the daytime
  under stones, while they are regularly all astir at night in search of worms and all kinds of
  small insects.</p>

  <p>The spawning takes place several times during the spring and summer. The amplexus is lumbar,
  and the eggs are extruded singly. They sink to the bottom, or are attached to water-plants. The
  oviposition takes a long time, perhaps the whole night, and several dozen eggs, not hundreds as in
  the allied genera, make a set. The egg, with its swollen gelatinous capsule, is large for so small
  a creature, namely 7-8 mm. in diameter. The embryos escape after a week, and the tadpoles reach
  two inches in total length. Those of <i>B. igneus</i> have a triangular mouth, but in <i>B.
  pachypus</i> this is elliptical, as in <i>Alytes</i> and <i>Discoglossus</i>. Metamorphosis is
  completed in the same autumn; the little toad is then about 15 mm. long, and differs from the
  adult by the absence of the conspicuous coloration of the under parts. In reasonable conformity
  herewith it does not take up the warning attitude. The colour appears gradually during the second
  year, but full growth is generally not reached until the third year. They do not hibernate in the
  water, but hide on land out of the reach of frost.</p>

  <p><i>Alytes.</i>&ndash;The tympanum is distinct, the pupil vertical, the omosternum is absent.
  The only two species live in South-Western Europe. The male attaches the eggs to its hind limbs,
  and nurses them until they are hatched.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page158"><span class="smaller">{158}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>A. obstetricans</i>, the "Midwife-toad," has the general appearance of a smooth toad. The
  upper parts are rather smooth, sometimes almost shiny, in spite of the numerous more or less
  prominent warts, of which those of the lateral lines, and those above the ear, are generally most
  marked. The colour of the upper parts varies a great deal according to the prevalence of greenish
  and reddish spots upon the grey or brown ground-colour. The red is sometimes, especially in the
  breeding males, rather conspicuous on the parotoid region and on the upper sides of the body. The
  under parts are whitish grey. The iris is pale golden, with black veins. The male has no vocal
  sac, and is as a rule smaller than the female, the latter reaching a length of two inches.</p>

  <p>This species occurs in the whole of the Iberian Peninsula and in France, extending into
  Switzerland and beyond the Rhine valley into Thuringia. Altitude above the sea does not seem to
  have any influence upon its range, which reaches from sea-level to the tops of subalpine
  mountains. I have found great quantities of its tadpoles in Portugal on the Serra d'Estrella,
  nearly 6000 feet high, and they are recorded from 6500 feet in the Pyrenees. They seem to be
  ubiquitous in Spain and Portugal, not that they are often found or seen, but they are heard
  everywhere; besides, tadpoles are sure to be in the clear cold lakes on the tops of the
  mountain-ranges, in the dirty puddles caused by the village fountains, and in the sun-heated
  swampy ditches on the roadside with scarcely enough water to hold the wriggling mass. Wherever
  there is water within easy reach, on the lonely mountains, in fertile valleys, in the gardens of
  the busy towns, you hear during the whole night, from March to August, the double call-note of the
  male, sounding like a little bell; but to see the performer is quite a different matter. He sits
  in front of his hole, dug out by himself or appropriated from a mouse, in a crack of the bottom of
  a wall, under stones, or in a similar place into which he withdraws for the day.</p>

  <p>The pairing and the peculiar mode of taking care of the eggs by the male, which habit has given
  it the specific name <i>obstetricans</i>, the midwife, have been most carefully observed by A. de
  l'Isle du Dr&eacute;neuf, near Nantes. A condensed account has been given by Boulenger. Several males
  collect around a female on land, not in the water, and the successful one grasps <span
  class="pagenum" id="page159"><span class="smaller">{159}</span></span>her round the waist. For
  nearly half an hour the male lubricates the cloacal region of the female by more than one thousand
  strokes of his toes, whereupon the female extends the hind-limbs, forming with the bent hind-limbs
  of the male a receptacle for the eggs, which are then expelled with a sudden noise. The eggs are
  yellow and large, up to 5 mm. in diameter, and are fastened together in two rosary-like strings,
  several dozen making one set. During the expulsion of the eggs the male shifts its body forwards,
  clasps his fore-limbs round the female's head, and fecundates the eggs. After a rest he pushes
  first one hind-limb and then the other through the convoluted mass of eggs, which then have the
  appearance of being wound round the hind-limbs in a figure of 8. Then the sexes separate and the
  male withdraws with its precious load into its hole, which it, however, leaves during the
  following nights, in search of food, taking this opportunity to moisten the eggs in the dew,
  occasionally even immersing them in the water. After at least three weeks, when the larvae are
  nearly ready, he betakes himself to the nearest water, and the larvae burst the thereby softened
  gelatinous cover of the eggs. Not infrequently the same male ventures upon a second pairing, and
  adds another load to the one which already hampers its movements. The eggs being large, owing to
  the great amount of yellow food-yolk, the embryos are enabled to be hatched in a more advanced
  stage than in most other Anura. The larva develops only one pair of external gills within the egg.
  These appear first in the shape of oval bags upon the third branchial arch, which sprout out
  secondary branches, soon in their turn to be resorbed and replaced by the so-called internal gills
  before hatching.</p>

  <p>Fischer-Sigwart<a id="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> gives the following account of
  the growth of this species. The male took to the water, with its load of twenty to thirty eggs, on
  the 6th of June. The larvae escaped out at once, 16-17 mm. long, the body measuring 5 mm. On the
  14th they had reached 32 mm. in length, whereupon they grew very slowly, although they were well
  fed, in a temperature of about 50&deg; F. This same brood did not metamorphose until May of the next
  year. The growth took place as follows:&ndash;The hind-limbs appeared on the 8th of September,
  when the tadpoles were 50 mm. long; by the middle of the next May they <span class="pagenum"
  id="page160"><span class="smaller">{160}</span></span>had reached their greatest length, 76 mm.,
  the hind-limbs being 18 mm. long, whilst the fore-legs were just indicated. On the 21st of May the
  hind-limbs were 27 mm. long, and the whole creature was practically metamorphosed, except for the
  tail. The latter was resorbed on the 13th of July, and the little toads, 25 mm. in length, were
  actually smaller, certainly far less bulky and heavy, than the tadpoles, which had required one
  year and a quarter for their metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>The early broods probably finish their development by the autumn of the same year, but those
  which are born later, in July and August, certainly hibernate in the water. I have found very
  small tadpoles, scarcely 15 mm. long, on the Cantabrian mountains as late as the end of September,
  and rather large ones in the spring at the time of first pairing; the fact that this takes place
  during the whole summer explains the occurrence of tadpoles in all stages of development almost
  the whole year round.</p>

  <p><i>A. cisternasi</i> has only two palmar tubercles, the middle or third one of <i>A.
  obstetricans</i> being absent; the outer finger is short and thick. Instead of a very long and
  wide fronto-parietal fontanelle, the fronto-parietal bones diverge only in front so that there are
  two fontanelles, a small one in the parietal and a large triangular one in the frontal region. The
  limbs are relatively shorter and stouter in conformity with the habits of this species, which
  prefers to burrow in sandy localities. Otherwise it leads the same kind of life as <i>A.
  obstetricans</i>, and the male carries the eggs. It has hitherto been found in Central Spain and
  in the middle provinces of Portugal.</p>

  <p><i>Liopelma</i> is intermediate between <i>Alytes</i> and <i>Bombinator</i>, agreeing with the
  latter, in conformity with its essentially aquatic life, in the absence of a tympanum, while the
  Eustachian tubes are entirely suppressed. The tongue is disc-shaped, but is slightly free behind.
  The pupil is triangular. The male is devoid of a vocal sac. <i>L. hochstetteri</i> is the sole
  representative of the Amphibia in New Zealand, where it is apparently rare. The upper parts are
  covered with smooth tubercles, and are dark brown with blackish spots; the under parts are
  whitish. Total length only 1&frac12; inch.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Pelobatidae.</b>&ndash;The upper jaw and, as a rule, the vomers are provided with
  teeth. The tongue is oval, slightly <span class="pagenum" id="page161"><span
  class="smaller">{161}</span></span>nicked, and free behind, so that it can be thrown out, except
  in <i>Asterophrys turpicola</i> of New Guinea, which has a large but entirely adherent tongue. The
  vertebrae are procoelous, except in <i>Asterophrys</i> and the Malay genus <i>Megalophrys</i>,
  where they are opisthocoelous. The sacral diapophyses are strongly dilated. The omosternum is
  small and cartilaginous. The metasternum has a bony style, and ends in a cartilaginous, rounded or
  heart-shaped disc, but in <i>Scaphiopus</i> it forms an entirely cartilaginous plate. The tympanic
  disc is mostly hidden or indistinct, and is quite absent in <i>Pelobates</i>. The Eustachian tubes
  are very small in <i>Pelobates</i>, and exceedingly minute in <i>Scaphiopus stagnalis</i> of New
  Mexico. The pupil is vertical. This family contains seven genera with about twenty species, with a
  rather scattered distribution.</p>

  <p><i>Pelobates</i> ("Spade-foot").&ndash;The tympanum is absent; the toes are webbed. The inner
  tarsal tubercle is large, and is transformed into a shovel which is covered with a hard,
  sharp-edged, horny sheath. The skin of the upper surface of the head is partly co-ossified with
  the underlying cranial bones, giving them a pitted appearance. The general shape is toad-like.</p>

  <p><i>P. fuscus.</i>&ndash;The smooth skin is brown above, with darker marblings, while the under
  parts are whitish, but the coloration varies greatly, from pale to dark brown or olive-grey with
  more or less prominent irregular dark, sometimes confluent, patches. Some specimens are adorned
  with numerous red spots. The tarsal spur is yellow or light brown. The iris is metallic red or
  golden. The male has a long oval gland on the upper surface of the upper arm, and although
  possessed of a voice, has no vocal sacs. The total length of full-grown females is nearly 3
  inches, that of males half an inch less.</p>

  <p>The "Spade-footed Toad," which occurs throughout the whole of Central Europe, extends from
  Belgium and the middle of France to North-Western Persia, and from the southern end of Sweden to
  Northern Italy. It prefers sandy localities, in order to dig its deep hole, in which it sits
  concealed during the daytime. Owing to the looseness of the sand, the hole is filled up so that no
  trace of its inhabitant is left. The digging is done by means of the spades, and in suitable
  localities the animal soon vanishes, sinking backwards out of sight. Except in the breeding
  season, or at night, it is therefore found only accidentally. The sand-loving habits do not,
  however, prevent it from enjoying moist localities. Several which I have kept for years dig
  themselves into the wettest moss in preference to the drier parts of their habitation. Being
  thoroughly nocturnal, they hunt after nightfall, the food consisting of all sorts of insects and
  of worms. When captured they utter a startling shrill cry, and their skin becomes covered with a
  dermal secretion which smells like garlic, a peculiarity which has given them in Germany the name
  of "Knoblauchskr&ouml;te," "garlic-toad." Although they become very tame, so that they no longer smell
  when handled, they can be made ill-tempered by being pinched or otherwise teased, whereupon they
  take up a defiant attitude, and with open mouth continue to cry for several minutes. Some such
  scenes occur now and then, without <span class="pagenum" id="page163"><span
  class="smaller">{163}</span></span>my interference, with the specimens which share their abode
  with several species of <i>Amblystoma</i> and <i>Spelerpes</i>; there are heard now and then
  sudden loud yells, like the squeak of a cat or the yapping of a little dog.</p>

  <p>In the spring the Spade-footed Toads take to the water for about a week, and the male's
  call-note is an ever-repeated clucking sound, which can also be produced under water, with the
  mouth shut, the air being shifted backwards and forwards through the larynx. The male grasps his
  mate below the waist; the eggs are combined into one thick string, which is about 18 inches long,
  and is wound round and between the leaves and stalks of water-plants. The eggs measure 2-2.5 mm.,
  and are very numerous, a large string containing several thousands. The larvae are hatched on the
  fifth or sixth day in a very unripe condition. They are only 4 mm. long, quite black, and still
  devoid of gills and tail. They attach themselves to the empty gelatinous egg-membranes, which they
  possibly live upon. On the following day the tail begins to grow; two days later fringed external
  gills sprout out and serve for about ten days, when they in turn give way to new, inner gills. The
  little tadpoles then leave their moorings and become independent. The hind-limbs appear in the
  ninth week, the fore-limbs in the twelfth. At the age of three months they begin to leave the
  water. The most remarkable feature is the enormous size of the full-grown tadpole, the body of
  which is as large as a pigeon's egg; the usual total length, including the tail, amounts to about
  4 inches or 100 mm., but occasionally regular monsters are found. This was the case some thirty
  years ago, when the Berlin Museum received a number of tadpoles, the largest of which measured
  nearly 7 inches. They were found in the month of December near Berlin, in a deep clay-pit with
  high, steep walls, so that the tadpoles were prevented from leaving the water. Similarly hemmed-in
  broods probably hibernate in the water under the ice, and such instances have been recorded.
  Normally they metamorphose into the much smaller toad within the same year.</p>

  <p><i>P. cultripes.</i>&ndash;This is the Spade-foot of the whole of Spain and Portugal and of the
  southern and western parts of France. It is similar in habits to <i>P. fuscus</i>, from which it
  differs but slightly. The tarsal spur is black, and there is a parieto-squamosal bridge which
  completely roofs over the temporal fossa <span class="pagenum" id="page164"><span
  class="smaller">{164}</span></span>and closes the orbit behind.&ndash;Boulenger has discovered the
  rare, individual occurrence of minute teeth on the parasphenoid and on the pterygoids of this
  species. These teeth are unquestionably the last reminiscences of a condition almost entirely
  superseded in the recent Anura.</p>

  <p><i>P. syriacus</i> from Asia Minor and Syria agrees with <i>P. cultripes</i> in the cranial
  configuration, but has the yellow or brown spur of <i>P. fuscus</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Scaphiopus.</i>&ndash;The Spade-foot of North America and Mexico differs slightly from those
  of Europe, chiefly by the presence of a more or less hidden tympanum and of a subgular vocal sac,
  and by the sternum, which forms an entirely cartilaginous plate without a special style. The close
  relationship of these two genera is further indicated by the occurrence of peculiar large
  glandular complexes in some of the species, pectoral in <i>S. solitarius</i>, tibial in <i>S.
  multiplicatus</i> of Mexico. At the same time this genus approaches <i>Pelodytes</i>.&ndash;About
  eight species are known, two of which inhabit the United States, the others Mexico.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page165"><span class="smaller">{165}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>S. solitarius</i> is the commonest species of the Southern States. It is brown above, with
  darker patches; its total length is about 2 inches. According to Holbrook it excavates small holes
  half a foot deep, in which it resides, seizing upon such unwary insects as may enter its dwelling.
  It never leaves the hole except in the evening or after long-continued rains. It appears early in
  March, and soon pairs; as an instance of hardiness Holbrook mentions that he has met it whilst
  there was still snow on the ground. When teased they assume a humble attitude, bending the head
  downwards with their eyes shut, as illustrated by Boulenger.<a id="NtA_78"
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Pelodytes</i> is, like the rest of the genera, devoid of the tarsal digging spur. The
  tympanic disc is rather indistinct; the male has a subgular sac. The general appearance of the
  slender body with long hind-limbs and toes is frog-like. Two species only are known, one in
  South-Western Europe, the other in the Caucasus.</p>

  <p><i>P. punctatus.</i>&ndash;The "Mud-diver" has the upper parts covered with small warts, and is
  about 1&frac12; inch in length. Its coloration is variable, and changes much. One day it may appear
  greenish brown, the next day pale grey; in the daytime perhaps with many bright green spots, and
  in the evening spotless and unicoloured. The under parts are mostly white, sometimes with a fleshy
  tinge. The male has a voice like "kerr-kerr" or "creck-creck," uttered during the breeding season,
  which lasts from the end of February until May, according to the temperature and the more Southern
  or Northern locality. Occasionally they breed a second time in the summer or autumn. The male
  develops nuptial excrescences, chiefly three rough patches on the inner side of the fore-limbs or
  on the inner side of the first two fingers, while the belly and thighs are covered with small
  granules. In the mode of copulation, the laying of the small and numerous eggs, the hatching of
  the larvae in a tail- and gill-less condition, this genus closely resembles <i>Pelobates</i>; but
  the tadpoles never reach a colossal size, the usual length being 2 inches, and even this is
  comparatively large for so small a species. It inhabits the greater part of France, most of
  Portugal, and the southern half of Spain, avoiding, however, the central plateaux and the
  mountain-ranges. Its habits are essentially nocturnal, <span class="pagenum" id="page166"><span
  class="smaller">{166}</span></span>living in the immediate vicinity of the water, into which it
  hops with a long jump in order to hide in the mud. Easily kept, it breeds regularly in captivity,
  according to circumstances at almost any time of the year.</p>

  <p><i>P. caucasicus</i> has been discovered in the Caucasus at an altitude of 7000 feet. The
  remaining genera of this family contain only a few species each, and are restricted to
  South-Western Asia, the Malay and Papuan Islands. The commonest is <i>Leptobrachium</i>, which
  ranges from the Himalayas to Borneo and Java. Pupil vertical. Vomerine teeth sometimes absent.
  Tongue roundish, very slightly nicked behind. Tympanum indistinct. Omosternum small,
  cartilaginous. Male with internal vocal sacs. Tarsus with a roundish tubercle. Some of the
  species, e.g. <i>L. carinense</i> from the Karen Hills, attain to a large size, namely, 6 inches;
  they seem to live on rats and mice, and one specimen contained a young squirrel.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Bufonidae</b> (Toads).&ndash;The formula:&ndash;no teeth in the upper and lower
  jaws, vertebrae procoelous and without ribs, sacral diapophyses dilated,&ndash;is sufficiently
  diagnostic of this cosmopolitan family. The generally entertained notion that toads have a rather
  thick-set, short-limbed, warty appearance, does not apply to all the members of the family. The
  majority are quite terrestrial, many are burrowing, the Javanese <i>Nectes</i> is aquatic, the
  Afro-Indian <i>Nectophryne</i> is arboreal, while the Australian <i>Myobatrachus</i> and the
  Mexican <i>Rhinophrynus</i> eat termites and are correspondingly modified; lastly, <i>Bufo
  jerboa</i> is a slender, long-legged creature.</p>

  <p>Teeth are almost entirely absent, except in <i>Notaden</i>, which has teeth on the vomers. The
  omosternum is mostly absent, except in <i>Engystomops</i> and in some species of <i>Bufo</i>,
  while in <i>Notaden</i> it is merely vestigial. The metasternum shows more variety. The tympanum
  is usually distinct, but varies even within the same genus, being hidden beneath the skin or being
  entirely absent. The terminal phalanges are modified according to the habits of the species, but
  they are never claw-shaped.</p>

  <p>The Bufonidae are connected in various directions. The Neotropical <i>Engystomops</i> greatly
  resembles the likewise Neotropical Cystignathoid <i>Paludicola</i>, and the Australian
  <i>Pseudophryne</i> closely approaches the Australian Cystignathoid <i>Crinia</i>. It is therefore
  all the more remarkable that a similar approach, in another direction, namely, towards the
  Firmisternal family of the <span class="pagenum" id="page167"><span
  class="smaller">{167}</span></span>Engystomatidae, is indicated by the Mexican <i>Rhinophrys</i>
  and the Australian <i>Myobatrachus</i>. However, since there are no true Engystomatidae in
  Australia, although several genera occur in Papuasia, these cases may be instances of convergence
  without necessarily implying relationship. An unmistakable line of connexion leads, according to
  Boulenger, to the Pelobatidae, the link being the Himalayan <i>Cophophryne</i>, with very strongly
  dilated sacral diapophyses, with a single condylar articulation of the coccyx with the sacral
  vertebra (as in some Indo-Malayan Pelobatidae), while this articulation is bicondylar in all the
  other Bufonidae.</p>

  <p>The whole family is divided into nine genera with more than a hundred species, of which only
  about fifteen do not belong to the genus <i>Bufo</i>. The distribution of the family is well-nigh
  cosmopolitan, with the remarkable exception of Madagascar, Papuasia, and the small islands of the
  Pacific; <i>Bufo</i> has been wrongly said to inhabit the Sandwich Islands. The greatest number of
  species, chiefly <i>Bufo</i>, occur in the Neotropical region, the greatest number of genera in
  Central America, where <i>Bufo</i> is rare, and in Australia, where it is absent.</p>

  <p><i>Engystomops</i> is interesting because it closely resembles the Cystignathoid genus
  <i>Paludicola</i>, and thereby seems to connect these two families. It differs from
  <i>Paludicola</i> chiefly by the absence of teeth, by the moderately dilated sacral diapophyses
  and by the slightly swollen tips of the fingers and toes, the end-phalanges of which are, in one
  species, <i>E. petersi</i>, <span class="sans fwb">T</span>- or anchor-shaped The tympanic disc is
  either distinct or hidden. The males have a large subgular vocal sac. The generic name refers to
  the small head with a prominent snout. Three species are known from Central America and
  Ecuador.</p>

  <p><i>Pseudophryne</i> appears to be another link with the Cystignathidae by its resemblance to
  the Australian genus <i>Crinia</i>, from which it differs by the absence of teeth and by the
  absence of an omosternum. The sacral diapophyses are but moderately dilated. The males have a flat
  oval gland on the hinder side of the thighs, and they are provided with a subgular vocal sac. The
  3 or 4 species of this genus which live in Australia, both East and West, are not unlike
  <i>Bombinator</i> in their general shape, short limbs and coloration. The skin of <i>P.
  australis</i> and <i>P. bibroni</i> is covered with small smooth warts and is blackish brown,
  while the under parts are blackish with large yellow <span class="pagenum" id="page169"><span
  class="smaller">{169}</span></span>patches. Total length little more than one inch. Concerning the
  breeding habits, see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page223">223</a></span>.</p>

  <p><i>Nectophryne.</i>&ndash;The sacral diapophyses are strongly dilated. <i>N. afra</i>, without
  a tympanum, but with fully-webbed digits and several broad, cushion-like or lamellar pads on the
  fingers and toes, inhabits the Cameroons, <i>N. tuberculosa</i> of Malabar, and <i>N.
  guentheri</i> and <i>N. hosei</i> of Borneo, have a visible tympanum and the fingers are webbed at
  the base only. These slender and long-legged species are most probably arboreal, as indicated by
  the broadened, but truncated, tips of their fingers and toes. <i>N. hosei</i> is about 4 inches
  long, <i>N. misera</i> is a little creature of only &frac34; inch in length. <i>Nectes</i>, hitherto
  known by one species, <i>N. subasper</i> of Java, is a swimmer and exceeds 6 inches in length. The
  tympanum is very distinct; the small nostrils look upwards. The toes are long and webbed to the
  tips; the hind-limbs are very long. The sacral diapophyses are strongly dilated. The skin of the
  upper parts is very rugose, covered with round warts, and dark brown; the under parts are granular
  and uniformly light brown.</p>

  <p><i>Bufo.</i>&ndash;The great number of species, more than 100, renders a strict definition of
  this genus difficult. The tongue is pear-shaped, thicker in front, entire, not cut out, but free
  behind, so that it can be projected. The fingers are free, the toes more or less webbed although
  never completely so. The terminal phalanges are obtuse and sometimes carry tiny discs. The
  omosternum is absent or merely vestigial. The metasternum is a rather large cartilaginous plate
  with a waist, which is sometimes incompletely calcified. The sacral diapophyses are moderately
  dilated. The tympanum is distinct or hidden. The skin of the upper parts is always rich in
  specific poison-glands, a concentration of which forms in many species very conspicuous, thickened
  parotoid glands. The surface of the skin may be smooth, moist and slimy, or rough and warty,
  sometimes covered with tiny, sharp, horny spikes and quite dry.</p>

  <p>The genus is cosmopolitan, with the exception of the whole Australian region and Madagascar,
  from which we may perhaps conclude that its original centre was not in Notogaea, in spite of the
  diversity of species in the Neotropical region, which now contains about half of all the species
  known. Next to Central America the Indian region is richest in species of <i>Bufo</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page170"><span class="smaller">{170}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>B. vulgaris.</i>&ndash;The Common Toad of the Palaearctic region. The skin of the upper
  parts is much wrinkled and beset with numerous round warts or poison-glands, the openings of which
  can be seen with the naked eye, especially on the large parotoid complexes. The outermost layer of
  the epiderm, in fact all that portion which is periodically shed, is elevated into numerous little
  cornified spines. The extent of their development varies much; southern specimens, especially
  those from Portugal, being perhaps the roughest. Others appear quite smooth to the touch, and this
  is the case with many English specimens. The skin of the under parts is more granular and devoid
  of specific glands. The general colour of the upper parts is olive grey to dark brown, more or
  less mottled; the under parts are whitish, often with a brown, yellow or reddish tinge.</p>

  <p>The coloration of this species varies considerably and is moreover very changeable. These
  changes depend chiefly upon the surroundings and the locality, in which certain styles of
  coloration seem to be the fashion, not necessarily to the absolute exclusion of others. Some
  specimens are of a rich brown colour, with or without dark brown spots and patches, and these are
  sometimes confluent, forming irregular, longitudinal bands. The ground-colour of other individuals
  is olive grey, with or without darker patches, and these paler tones prevail in toads which live
  on light-coloured soil, for instance on chalk. I recently found one between two dark-coloured
  slates, and this creature was so black that it gave the impression of having soiled itself with
  coal-dust. One and the same specimen will appear paler or darker according to its mood and the
  leading tones of its immediate surroundings, but it cannot change its dominant ground-colour. A
  third colour-variety occurs more frequently in the mountainous districts of Southern Europe. I
  have obtained the most handsome specimens in the Serra Gerez, in North Portugal. Their
  ground-colour is pale brownish-yellow, with many large and small, rich brown patches, or if the
  latter colour predominates, these patches and spots are separated from each other by creamy seams,
  with the occasional effect of dark brown, yellow-ringed eyes. Eastern Asiatic specimens often have
  a fine yellow vertebral line and the under parts are inclined to be marked with dark spots.</p>

  <p>The iris is red or coppery, mottled with black. The male <span class="pagenum"
  id="page171"><span class="smaller">{171}</span></span>has no vocal sacs, and, besides being
  smaller than the female, is distinguished by slight nuptial excrescences in the shape of little
  horny brushes on the inside of the inner palmar tubercle and the three inner fingers. The full
  size of this toad varies extremely. Taking the standard of everyday experience in England and
  Central Europe, one would call any female beyond 3&frac12; inches in length, and any male of more than 2&frac12;
  inches, unusually large. But occasionally they grow to a much larger size, especially in the
  mountains of Southern Europe, provided there is a rich vegetation of meadows and deciduous trees
  so as to insure a variety of plentiful food. Although Fatio<a id="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> mentions a toad 153 mm. = 6 inches long, and Boulenger succeeded
  in getting a toad from Paris which measured 132 mm., <i>i.e.</i> almost 5&frac14; inches, one of my
  specimens from the Serra Gerez seems to hold the record with a total length from snout to vent of
  135 mm. or more than 5&frac14; inches. Jersey is also famous for its large toads, possibly on account of
  the many large greenhouses. These large specimens do not constitute a special race. The monsters
  among them are without exception females, often but not always sterile, as I have often found
  large masses of eggs in them. Food is the chief cause. At least I have observed that the more
  voracious of some Spanish and Portuguese specimens, which were already 3&frac12; inches long, and
  therefore entitled to respect, continued to grow rather rapidly, adding about half an inch within
  a year. Again, if the growth of a promising toad is arrested for a season&ndash;not necessarily by
  starvation, but by uncongenial surroundings, sameness, and unvaried nature of food&ndash;they
  consolidate so to say, or settle down, and no amount of future good feeding will turn them into
  exceptionally big specimens. There are no data to tell how old such monsters really are. At least
  ten years are required by the Southerners to reach four inches. The usual length of life attained
  by a toad is likewise unknown. Boulenger kept one in a box provided with a sod, a pan of water and
  plenty of varied food, but twelve years of close captivity did not make any appreciable difference
  in its appearance.</p>

  <p>A number of large Spanish and Portuguese specimens in my greenhouse were at first very shy, and
  tried every possible means of escape or sullen hiding, but gradually they condescended to take
  food when lifted on to the slate-covered stage upon which their food was spread. After a few weeks
  they had learned this so thoroughly that, towards the usual hour of feeding, they climbed most
  laboriously on to the slates, lying in wait between the flower-pots, and coming forward when we
  entered the house. The rest of the day and night they spent on the ground, under stones or plants,
  each in its individual lair. The biggest of all, and several others, became so tame that they took
  food whilst sitting on the hand, and then they looked up for more. The food must be alive and show
  movement. Mealworms, snails, beetles and other small creatures are first carefully inspected with
  bent-down head, and are sometimes followed for a few inches; then comes an audible snap, a flash
  of the rosy tongue and the prey has disappeared. Large earthworms are nipped up with the jaws and
  laboriously poked in with the hands, the fingers being so placed as to clean the worm of adherent
  soil and other impurities. Very large worms are shaken, twisted, pressed against the ground and
  gulped down with convulsive movements, but not unfrequently the tip-end remains for some minutes
  sticking out of the tightly shut mouth. Several are taken at one sitting, until the toad is
  gorged. One of the biggest took full-grown mice, which <span class="pagenum" id="page173"><span
  class="smaller">{173}</span></span>were not "fascinated by the fiery eyes" but were stalked into a
  corner and then pounced upon immediately when they moved. The shells of snails can for half a day
  be felt through the body; they then dissolve or are disgorged. The dung, which is passed in large,
  long masses, is often full of fine earthy matter, the contents of the earthworm's intestines, and
  sometimes it contains the chitinous remains of certain beetles which are supposed to be
  excessively rare. I know of no instance of slugs being eaten.</p>

  <p>The regular hunting-time begins with the evening and is continued throughout bright nights, the
  toads crawling and hopping about. They are expert climbers of rocks, and succeed in reaching
  apparently inaccessible places by shoving themselves up between vertical walls, and taking
  advantage of any roughnesses for foothold. Every few weeks they shed their skins. Without any
  preliminary symptoms or loss of appetite or liveliness, the body makes a few twisting motions, the
  back is now and then curved, and the skin splits down the middle line. Owing to the more forcible
  contortions of the body it slides down to the right and left of the back, whereupon the toad gets
  hold of the peeling-off skin with fingers and toes, scraping the head and sides, and conveys the
  thin, transparent, slightly tinged skin into the mouth, slips out of it backwards and swallows it.
  The new surface is then quite wet and shiny, but it soon dries and hardens.</p>

  <p>Many toads, for instance the Common Toad and the Pantherine Toad, assume a peculiar attitude
  when surprised. Instead of blowing themselves up by filling their lungs with air, they raise
  themselves upon their four limbs as high as possible, but turning the back towards the enemy in a
  slanting position, either to the right or to the left side, apparently in order to present as much
  surface as possible, in other words to look their biggest.</p>

  <p>Some of my specimens hibernated regularly for a few months, burying themselves completely in
  loose, dry soil, under leaves, or,&ndash;a favourite place,&ndash;in a heap of cocoa-nut fibre.
  Others, and this applies also to English specimens transferred from the garden into the
  greenhouse, are lively all the year round, but even they withdraw for an occasional sleep of a few
  weeks at any time of the year.</p>

  <p>The whole family of large toads came to a sad end after four years, when they were put into new
  temporary quarters, a <span class="pagenum" id="page174"><span
  class="smaller">{174}</span></span>slate-bottomed terrarium. Being kept during my absence in
  wringing wet moss, which became fouled by their own excretions, they contracted a mysterious
  disease from which they never recovered. They are rather averse to wet surroundings, and except
  during the short pairing season they live in cool, shady places, preferably with just a little
  dampness. Occasionally they take a soaking bath. One specimen, living in the garden, repaired
  during the hot and dry summer nights to a standpipe in the garden, enjoying the occasional drips
  of water.</p>

  <p>Considering the amount of snails and other noxious creatures destroyed by them during their
  regular nocturnal hunts, toads are eminently useful creatures. Nevertheless, they suffer much
  through the stupid superstition of people who ought to know better. It is difficult to find a
  gentle, absolutely harmless and useful creature that is more maligned than the European toad. It
  brings ill-luck to the house, the "slimy toad" spits venom, sucks the cows' udders and after that
  destroys their power of giving milk; it poisons the milk in the cellar, and a certain builder's
  horse, which was grazing in the grounds of the Cambridge Museums, and died there from a large
  concrement obstructing its bowels, was solemnly declared to have swallowed one of my toads. Silly
  superstitions, owing to faulty, or rather entire want of, observation! The toad is not slimy, but
  dry; it is often found in buildings, where it keeps down the woodlice; it cannot suck, nor does it
  drink at all; it does not spit venom, but becomes covered with milky white and very strong poison
  when in acute agony, for instance when trodden upon; and unless the big skin-glands be forcibly
  squeezed, there will be no squirting. Therefore, leave it alone, or put down food on its evening
  beat, and it will soon come to know and to recognise its friends.</p>

  <p>The Common Toad can exist without food for a long time, provided the locality is cool and damp,
  but it wastes away almost to skin and bones. In order to disprove the persistently cropping up
  fable and sensational newspaper-accounts of toads having been discovered immured in buildings,
  where they were supposed to have lived for many years, Frank Buckland put a dozen specimens into
  separate holes bored in a block of porous limestone, covered them up tightly with a glass plate
  and buried the block a yard deep in the soil. A second dozen were treated similarly, but were put
  into a block of dense sandstone. After a <span class="pagenum" id="page175"><span
  class="smaller">{175}</span></span>year and two weeks all the toads enclosed in the latter block
  were of course found dead and decomposed, but most of those in the porous block were still alive,
  with their eyes open, and did not succumb to starvation until eighteen months of confinement.
  These poor creatures could of course not move about, and were practically undergoing enforced
  continuous hibernation. Otherwise they would soon have wasted away and have died within six
  months. Those which tumble into deep and dry wells remain rather small, but generally manage to
  keep alive for years on the spiders, woodlice, earwigs and other insects which likewise tumble
  in.</p>

  <p>Toads hibernate far from the water in dry holes or clefts, retiring in the middle of October in
  Central Europe, and they do not reappear before March. Soon after, and this depends naturally upon
  the season, they congregate in ponds or pools, and the males, which far outnumber the females, for
  whom they fight, make a peculiar little noise, something like the whining bleat of a lamb,
  uttering this sound day and night. The male having, after much wrestling with competitors, secured
  a female, which is often several times bigger than himself, clasps her tightly, by pressing his
  fists into the armpits, and the pair swim or crawl about in this position sometimes for a week
  before the spawning takes place. The number of eggs laid at one sitting is enormous, varying from
  2000 to 7000. They are very small, only 1.5-2.0 mm. in diameter, and are expelled in two double
  rows or strings, one coming out of each oviduct. These strings consist of a soft gelatinous mass,
  in which the double rows of entirely black eggs are imbedded, and they measure in the swollen
  condition about 6 mm. or &frac14; inch in diameter, and from 10 to 15 feet in length. The strings are
  wound round and between water-plants by the parents, which move about during the laying and
  fertilising process. According to the coldness or warmth of the season the larvae are hatched in
  about a fortnight, and for the next few days they hang on to the dissolving gelatinous mass of the
  egg-strings. They then leave the slime and fasten themselves by means of their suckers to the
  under side of grasses and water-plants or sticks, with their tails hanging downwards, still in a
  rudimentary condition, but henceforth progressing rapidly.</p>

  <p>Fischer-Sigwart<a id="NtA_80" href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> found the time of development
  as follows:&ndash;The <span class="pagenum" id="page176"><span
  class="smaller">{176}</span></span>eggs were laid on the 6th of March; the larvae left the jelly
  on the 16th, being 4 mm. long. On the 2nd of April they measured 13 mm.; on the 25th, 20 mm. On
  the 7th of May the hind-limbs appeared. On the 18th of May the tadpoles had reached their greatest
  length, namely 24 mm., and this is a rather small size for so large a species. The fore-limbs
  broke through on the 28th, and the metamorphosis was completed eighty-five days after the eggs
  were laid, the creatures leaving the water on the 30th of May. The tadpoles showed a preference
  for rotten pieces of <i>Agaricus</i>, which were floating in the water. The little baby-toads are
  surprisingly small, scarcely 15 mm. long, and live in the grass, under stones, in cracks of the
  ground, and hop about in much better style than their heavier and more clumsy-looking parents.
  Where many broods have been hatched they can be met with in myriads, the ground literally swarming
  with them, and as they are naturally stirred up by a sudden warm rain, perhaps after a drought,
  people will occasionally state it as an observed and well-ascertained fact that "it has rained
  toads."</p>

  <p>What becomes of all these hopeful little creatures? Although it takes them fully five years to
  reach maturity, one would expect that the whole country would be swarming with toads; but since
  this is not the case, there being not more toads now than there were before, it follows that their
  enormous fecundity is only just sufficient to keep the race going. Adult toads seem to have
  scarcely any enemies except the Grass Snake, which takes them in default of anything better. But
  how about the reduction where there are no snakes? We know nothing about epidemics which might
  carry them off, but elderly toads are liable to a horrible disease produced by various kinds of
  flies, notably by <i>Lucilia bufonivora</i> and <i>Calliphora silvatica</i>, the maggots of which
  somehow or other eat their way from the nostrils into the brain and into the eyes. Those which
  reach the brain at first produce effects similar to those of <i>Coenurus cerebralis</i>, the
  hydatid or bladder-worm of sheep. The toad inclines its head towards one side, and cannot crawl
  straight, but walks in a circle. By eating away the brain they gradually destroy the host's life.
  But if none enter the brain, and a few only find their way into the eye, they only impair or
  destroy its sight. Such toads show signs of pain, poking at or stroking the affected eye, which
  becomes <span class="pagenum" id="page177"><span class="smaller">{177}</span></span>inflamed, and
  ultimately remains enlarged, with the iris partially or entirely destroyed by the maggot, which
  does not develop further, but dies in the eye-chamber, this being really an unsuitable place for
  it. The eyesight is of course affected, and is mostly, but not in all cases, lost. Such half-blind
  individuals&ndash;the disease affecting sometimes one eye only&ndash;recover their health, and
  except for a little awkwardness, behave like normal specimens. This applies to <i>Bufo
  vulgaris</i> as well as to <i>B. calamita</i>. Australian Anura are cursed with a fly of their
  own, called <i>Batrachomyia</i>.<a id="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>B. vulgaris</i> inhabits almost the whole of the Palaearctic region;&ndash;the whole of
  Europe, with the exception of Ireland, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia and Corsica. Northwards it
  extends to Trondhjem, and thence along a line drawn across Russia and Siberia to the Amoor. Its
  southern limit in Asia is indicated by a line drawn from the Caucasus through the Himalayas into
  China. In Asia Minor and in Persia it is absent. South of the Mediterranean it occurs only in
  Morocco and Algeria.</p>

  <p><i>B. melanostictus</i> is the common toad of the whole Indian region and of the Malay
  Archipelago. The epidermis of the fingers and toes is thicker and more cornified than usual, and
  is stained black brown, hence its specific name. The male has a subgular vocal sac. In other
  respects the Indian species much resembles the more spinous or rough-skinned and brown varieties
  of the European species. According to S. S. Flower this toad is very common in the Straits
  Settlements, hiding by day under stones or logs, or in holes, coming out shortly before sunset,
  and remaining abroad till dawn; it may be met with on the roads and in the grass, hopping or
  crawling about in search of ants, bees, and similar food. It utters a rather feeble, plaintive cry
  when handled for the first time. It can change its colour from light yellowish to dark brown. The
  spawn, which resembles that of <i>B. vulgaris</i>, may be seen in March and April in ponds, in
  long strings twined about the water-weeds. The tadpoles are very like those of the common English
  toad in form, size, colour, and structure of mouth. The largest adult found in Penang measured 115
  mm. (about 4 inches) from snout to vent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page178"><span class="smaller">{178}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>B. lentiginosus</i> s. <i>americanus</i> is the common toad of North America, from Mexico to
  the Great Bear Lake. It is worth noting that this species resembles in its coloration the Eastern
  races of <i>B. vulgaris</i>, in so far as they generally have a light vertebral line, and
  frequently dark spots on the under surface. The upper parts are brown and olive, with darker
  spots, two of which form a chevron behind the eyes. But the tympanum is large, and the male has a
  subgular vocal sac; the inner metatarsal tubercle is very large, and is used as a kind of digging
  spur. During the pairing time they take to the pools in great numbers, uttering their music, which
  consists of a prolonged trill, continued by different individuals, both day and night. Holbrook
  knew an individual which was kept for a long time, and became perfectly tame. During the summer
  months it retired to a corner of the room into a habitation which it had prepared for itself in a
  small quantity of earth placed there for its convenience. Towards the evening it wandered about in
  search of food. Some water having been squeezed from a sponge upon its head one hot day in July,
  it returned the next day to the spot, and seemed well pleased with the repetition, nor did it fail
  during the extreme heat of the summer to repair to it frequently in search of its shower-bath.</p>

  <p>Several varieties of this widely distributed species, whose average length is 2&frac12; inches, have
  been described. The prettiest was called <i>B. quercinus</i> by Holbrook&ndash;according to whom
  it is mostly found in sandy places covered with a small species of oak&ndash;which springs up
  abundantly where pine-forests have been destroyed. It is called the "oak-frog," as it spends most
  of its time in concealment under fallen oak-leaves, or partially buried in the sand.</p>

  <p><i>B. marinus</i> s. <i>agua</i> is the giant among toads, and is one of the commonest species
  of the Neotropical region, ranging from the Antilles and Mexico to Argentina. It frequently
  reaches a length of 6 inches, with a width of 4 inches when squatting down in its favourite
  attitude. The upper parts are rough, owing to the prominent warty glands, of which the parotoid
  complex is enormous. The general colour above is dark brown, with sooty dark patches; below
  whitish, often with blackish patches. This creature appears at dusk, often in large numbers,
  especially during the rainy season, hopping about, not crawling, with surprising <span
  class="pagenum" id="page179"><span class="smaller">{179}</span></span>activity. The voice of the
  male, strengthened by a subgular sac, is said to be a kind of loud snoring bark. The pairing time
  begins, according to Hensel,<a id="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> with the winter rainy
  season, especially June, and lasts several months, until October, but it is interrupted by the
  cold, which in the hills of South-Eastern Brazil covers the ponds with ice. Then the tremulous
  bass voice of the males is heard no longer; they have all withdrawn beneath stones and trees in
  the neighbourhood of the water. The eggs are laid in strings. The larvae are at first quite black
  and very small, and the young baby-toads are only 1 cm. in length. They differ considerably from
  the adult until they are more than 1 inch long; the upper parts are yellowish brown, with darker
  ocellated patches, each with a light seam, most conspicuous along the sides of the head and back.
  The under parts are grey, finely stippled with yellow.</p>

  <p>Budgett<a id="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> remarks that <i>B. marinus</i> feeds on
  all kinds of insects. "One half-grown specimen sitting by a man's foot picked off fifty-two
  mosquitoes in the space of one minute, picking them up with the tongue as they settled. The call
  of this very common toad consists of three bell-like notes; the middle one being the highest. The
  enormous parotoid glands are discharged like squirts when the creature is roughly handled. When
  wet weather comes on it hops out from its hiding-place to sit in a puddle, with its head out."</p>

  <p>In many species of <i>Bufo</i> the crown of the head forms more or less prominent ridges,
  especially strong in the region between the eyes; for instance, in <i>B. melanostictus</i> and
  <i>B. lentiginosus</i>. The skin overlying these ridges is liable to be involved in the cranial
  ossification, and this reaches its greatest extent in the two Cuban species <i>B. empusus</i> and
  <i>B. peltocephalus</i>. It is a curious coincidence, to say the least, that such dermal
  ossifications should be best developed in Neotropical species, in those very countries which
  amongst the Cystignathidae have produced the abnormal genera <i>Triprion</i>,
  <i>Calyptocephalus</i>, and <i>Pternohyla</i>. The most peculiar and odd-looking species is
  <i>Bufo ceratophrys</i>, a native of Ecuador, which has the upper eyelid produced into a horn-like
  appendage, the two sharply-pointed cones standing out transversely, reminding us of several
  species of the Cystignathoid genus <i>Ceratophrys</i>; there is also a series of four small
  pointed <span class="pagenum" id="page180"><span class="smaller">{180}</span></span>appendages on
  each side of the body. Protective concealment is possibly the reason of these queer
  outgrowths.</p>

  <p><i>B. viridis</i> s. <i>variabilis</i>, the Green or Variable Toad, reaches a length of about 3
  inches, and is the prettiest toad of Europe. The skin is distinctly smooth, the numerous porous,
  large and small warts being flattened. Parotoid glands are well developed, and a similar pair of
  glands sometimes occurs on the inner side of the calf, especially in Central Asiatic and in
  Algerian specimens. The coloration is very variable and changeable. The ground-colour of the upper
  parts is creamy, with large and small, partly confluent and irregularly shaped spots and patches
  of green, here and there interspersed with vermilion-red specks, especially along the sides of the
  back. The under parts are whitish, sometimes spotted with black. The iris is brass-coloured,
  greenish-yellow, with fine dark dots. The male does not differ from the female in size, but has an
  internal subgular vocal sac, a conspicuous callosity on the inner side of the first finger, and
  nuptial brushes on the first three fingers and on the inner palmar tubercle.</p>

  <p>The changing of colour affects mainly the intensity of the green; the same individual which now
  looks almost uniformly dull, almost grey, with dusky olive patches, will, if put into grass and
  sprinkled with water, within a few minutes appear in a tastefully combined garb of grass-green on
  a creamy ground. Some Southern and Eastern specimens have a creamy stripe along the vertebral
  line, thereby closely resembling <i>B. calamita</i>, from which, however, they can always be
  distinguished by the little pads below the joints of the toes; these pads being single in B.
  viridis, and double in <i>B. calamita</i> and in <i>B. vulgaris</i>.</p>

  <p>The Green Toad spends most of the day in holes, although it is not averse to daylight, and it
  roams about chiefly in the evening. It can jump well, much better and oftener than the Brown Toad.
  The food consists strictly of insects of all kinds, and most individuals prefer slow starvation to
  eating an earthworm. Although continuing to live four or five years in captivity, they do not
  readily become tame; they are indeed no longer wild, and when handled they no longer emit their
  peculiar insipid smell, but on being approached they still crouch deeply into the grass, or
  withdraw into their holes, just as they did when recently caught. The voice is heard during the
  pairing season, and sounds like the slow creaking of a door, or a combination of a spinning top
  and <span class="pagenum" id="page181"><span class="smaller">{181}</span></span>rattle. In
  Germany, during the months of April and May, they take to the ponds, or, improvident like the
  common frog, to a roadside ditch. The male sits upon the female and grasps her below the arms, his
  hands on her breast, and in this position they remain for days. The eggs are laid in two strings,
  twisted around water-plants, and are very numerous. H&eacute;ron-Royer has calculated them at 10,000 or
  more in one set. The embryos are hatched, like those of the Common Toad, before the appearance of
  the external gills and of the tail. In this imperfect condition they remain in the jelly of the
  egg-strings for a few days, while their external gills sprout out like unbranched little stumps,
  only to disappear again. In about eight weeks the tadpoles, which reach a length little more than
  1&frac12; inch or 40 mm., have metamorphosed and leave the water as baby-toads scarcely half an inch in
  length.</p>

  <p>This species has a very wide range, namely, the whole of Middle Europe excepting the British
  Isles, France and the Iberian Peninsula; the region between the Elbe and Rhine being its western
  limit; southwards it extends over all the Mediterranean islands and the north coast of Africa,
  eastwards through the whole of Russia, Western and Central Asia, not entering India, but spreading
  along the Himalayas into China. Stoliczka mentions its having been found in the Himalayas at an
  altitude of 15,000 feet, the highest record of any Amphibian, at least in such latitudes.</p>

  <p><i>B. calamita.</i>&ndash;The Natterjack is practically the representative of the Green Toad in
  Western Europe, but both species occur together in Denmark, Southern Sweden, and nearly the whole
  of Germany. Its southern limit is Gibraltar. In the British Isles it occurs in South-Western
  Ireland, in Co. Kerry, and in England and Wales, being however local, and preferring sandy
  localities, where it is found in considerable numbers. This predilection is shown by its frequency
  on the sandy dunes of most of the islands off the German and Dutch coast, where it may be seen
  running about in glaring sunshine.</p>

  <p>Besides in the coloration, it differs from <i>B. viridis</i> in the following points. The
  little subarticular pads of the toe-joints are paired, not single, and the hind-limbs are
  decidedly shorter, so much so that this species cannot hop. But it runs well, like a mouse,
  generally in jerks, stopping every few seconds, and owing <span class="pagenum" id="page182"><span
  class="smaller">{182}</span></span>to this habit it is called the "running toad" by the
  field-labourers of Cambridgeshire. The skin is smooth, but less so than in <i>B. viridis</i>,
  owing to the slightly more prominent warts; the parotoids are small; a similar pair of glands lies
  on the upper surface of the fore-arm and another on the calf. The tympanum is rather indistinct.
  The ground-colour of the upper parts is light brownish yellow, with a green tinge and scattered
  green spots; most specimens have a narrow yellow stripe along the vertebral line and over the
  head. The under parts are white, more or less speckled with black. The iris is greenish yellow and
  speckled. The male, which is of the same size as the female,&ndash;very large specimens reaching 3
  inches in length,&ndash;has a large subgular vocal sac, and develops nuptial brushes on the first
  three fingers, but the first lacks the thickened pad of <i>B. viridis</i>.</p>

  <p>The yellow vertebral line is sometimes absent in specimens from the south of France and the
  Iberian Peninsula; and since these southerners are as a rule more handsomely marked, the green
  being more pronounced and arranged in larger patches, interspersed with red spots, they much
  resemble <i>B. viridis</i>. Boulenger, who has paid especial attention to this vertebral streak,
  which is a not uncommon design in various species of different families, has made the interesting
  observation that the streak has never been found in Danish and German specimens of <i>B.
  viridis</i>, where <i>B. calamita</i> occurs also, while it is not uncommon in <i>B. viridis</i>
  of Italy, South-Eastern Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where <i>B. calamita</i> is not found.
  Lastly, he remarks that in Eastern Asia, where neither <i>B. viridis</i> nor <i>B. calamita</i>
  with such a line occurs, the same character is assumed by some specimens of <i>B. vulgaris</i>.
  The only conclusion we can draw from these facts is, that for some unknown reason the streak is a
  desirable, but not necessary, possession, but that it is not kept by two species in the same
  country, <i>B. viridis</i> dropping it entirely where the typically streaked species, <i>B.
  calamita</i>, also occurs. The breeding season does not begin in England and Middle Europe until
  the end of April, in cold springs not before May, but it lasts for several months. The males,
  congregating in pools in great numbers, make a loud noise, each individual uttering a rattling
  note which lasts a few seconds, the repetition distending its bluish throat into the shape of a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page183"><span class="smaller">{183}</span></span>globe as large as its
  head. As the note is taken up by all the other males, a continuous chorus is established, which on
  warm and still nights can be heard nearly a mile off. Single croaks are uttered at any time of the
  day. The embrace, the male digging its fists into the armpits of the female, often takes place on
  land, near the edge of the water, to which they resort in the night for spawning. The egg-strings
  are slung around water-plants, unless the water is a mere puddle, and are much shorter than those
  of <i>B. viridis</i>, measuring only 5 to 6 feet, and containing altogether 3000 to 4000 eggs. The
  larvae, when hatched, are very small, imperfect, and blackish; the external gills last a very
  short time. The young tadpoles live on mud, subsisting on diatoms and low Algae; they are the
  smallest tadpoles of all the European kinds, scarcely reaching more than one inch in length, and
  they metamorphose quickly, the baby-toads leaving the water and running about in less than six
  weeks, when they are only 10 mm., scarcely three-eighths of an inch, in length. By the end of
  their second summer they are still only three-quarters of an inch long, and they do not reach
  maturity until the fourth or fifth year, with a size of 1&frac12; to 2 inches; still smaller young males
  become mature several years before they are full grown.</p>

  <p>Natterjacks stand captivity well and become very tame. When discovered, they first do their
  best to run away, instead of hiding or squatting down, and when caught they become covered with a
  slightly foamy lather, the exudation of their glands, which has a peculiar smell, reminding some
  people of gunpowder, others of india-rubber. They are not very particular as to food, all sorts of
  insects and earthworms being taken. Natterjacks are great climbers and diggers. Many of mine have
  established themselves in the peat with which the walls of the greenhouse are covered, where they
  have dug out, or enlarged, holes in which they pass the daytime, just peeping out with their
  bright eyes; others sit high up, always in dry places, and bask. In the evening they descend,
  hunting about on the ground, and occasionally they go into the water, whereupon they become quite
  flaccid and soft. When taken up and held between two fingers, being slightly pressed under the
  armpits, both sexes utter little jerky notes, as&ndash;by the way&ndash;most toads and frogs do
  under similar conditions.</p>

  <p>In Cambridgeshire they frequent certain clay-pits surrounded <span class="pagenum"
  id="page184"><span class="smaller">{184}</span></span>by high and steep walls of sand, the
  breeding places of large colonies of sand-martins. During the months of May and June they are
  found in the shallow water, running about on the mud, sometimes swimming, in which they are not
  very proficient, and rarely diving. But they spend most of the time on land. Early in October they
  climb up and enter the holes of the sand-martins, or they dig large, deep burrows for hibernation,
  and the old males are the first to disappear.</p>

  <p><i>B. mauritanica</i> s. <i>pantherina</i>.&ndash;The "Pantherine Toad" is one of the few
  African species, and is one of the prettiest of all toads. The skin is almost smooth, although
  provided with porous glands. The parotoids are large, but flat; large glandular complexes on the
  legs or arms are absent. The tympanum is very distinct. The upper parts are adorned with a
  delicate pattern of dark-edged, rich brown or olive patches upon a light, buff-coloured ground;
  the under parts are uniform white; the male has a subgular vocal sac. The total length is 3 to 4
  inches. This beautiful species is one of the gentlest, and it becomes tame enough to lap up food
  whilst sitting on one's hand. It lives entirely upon insects, prefers shade and dusky light, and
  utters a sound like "kooh-rr." It is a native of North-Western Africa, Algiers, and Morocco. In
  the rest of Africa, from Egypt to the Cape, Senegambia to Abyssinia, it is represented by <i>B.
  regularis</i>. This species has often little spiny tubercles upon the warts, and occasionally a
  light vertebral line; the colour of the upper parts either closely resembles that of the previous
  species, or it is uniform light brown, while the under parts are whitish, or variegated with
  brownish patches. West African specimens are the smallest, only 2 inches long; those of the Cape
  are the largest, reaching 5 to 6 inches.</p>

  <p>The next two genera approach the Engystomatinae, and thereby lead from the arciferous towards
  the firmisternal type. The epicoracoid cartilages are narrow, and they scarcely overlap, so that
  by a further step in this direction they could easily fuse into the firmisternal condition.
  Another bond between these two genera and the Engystomatinae is their habits, they being
  ant-eaters of an extremely stout appearance, with exclusively short limbs and very small
  heads.</p>

  <p><i>Myobatrachus gouldi</i>, living in Australia, has a smooth skin, brown above, lighter
  beneath, and is about 2 inches long.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page185"><span class="smaller">{185}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Rhinophrynus dorsalis</i> of Mexico is remarkable for its tongue, which is elongated,
  subtriangular and free in front, so that it can be protruded directly&ndash;not by reversion as in
  other toads&ndash;and can be used for licking up the termites which seem to be its principal food.
  The body of this ugly creature is almost egg-shaped, and the head is merged into this mass, only
  the narrow truncated snout protruding. The limbs are very short and stout. The toes are more than
  half webbed, and there is a large oval, shovel-like metatarsal tubercle, covered with horn and
  used for digging. The general colour is brown, with a yellow stripe along the spine and with
  irregular spots and patches on the flanks and limbs. Total length 2 to 2&frac12; inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Hylidae</b> (Tree-frogs).&ndash;The upper jaw&ndash;in <i>Amphignathodon</i> the
  lower jaw also&ndash;and the vomers carry teeth; <i>Triprion</i> and <i>Diaglena</i> alone have
  teeth on the parasphenoid also, and the latter genus is further distinguished by possessing
  palatine teeth. The vertebrae are procoelous and have no ribs; the sacral diapophyses are dilated.
  The omo- and meta-sternum are cartilaginous, the latter forming a plate with scarcely any basal or
  style-shaped constriction. The terminal phalanges are invariably claw-shaped and swollen at the
  base, and carry a flattened, roundish, adhesive cushion. The tympanic disc is variable in
  appearance, being either free, or more or less hidden by the skin. The tongue is also variable in
  its shape and in the extent to which it can be protruded.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page186"><span class="smaller">{186}</span></span></div>

  <p>Most, if not all, Hylidae are climbers, and many lead an arboreal life, but it does not follow
  that all the "Tree-frogs" are green.</p>

  <p>Their distribution is very remarkable. To say that this family is cosmopolitan with the
  exception of the African region, is literally true, but very misleading. There are in all about
  150 species, and of these 100 are Notogaean; one-half of the whole number, or 75, being
  Neotropical; 23 are Central American, 7 Antillean, and about 18 are found in North America. One
  species, <i>Hyla arborea</i>, extends over nearly the whole Palaearctic sub-region, and two
  closely allied forms occur in Northern India and Southern China. Consequently, with this exception
  of three closely allied species, the Hylidae are either American or Australian. We conclude that
  their original home was Notogaea, and that they have spread northwards through Central and into
  North America. The enormous moist and steamy forests of South America naturally suggest themselves
  as a paradise for tree-frogs, and it is in this country, especially in the Andesian and the
  adjoining Central American sub-regions, that the greatest diversity of generic and specific forms
  has been produced. It is all the more remarkable that similar forest-regions, like those of Borneo
  and other Malay islands, are absolutely devoid of Hylidae (while there are about a dozen species
  in Papuasia), whose place has however been taken for all practical purposes by correspondingly
  modified Ranidae, notably the genus <i>Rhacophorus</i>. Lastly, the fact that tropical evergreen
  forests of Africa and Madagascar possess no Hylidae, but are inhabited by several kinds of
  tree-climbing <i>Rhacophorus</i>, points with certainty to the conclusion that the origin of this
  large and flourishing family of Hylidae was not in Arctogaea.</p>

  <p>The versatility and the wide distribution of the Hylidae has naturally produced cases of
  convergent analogy, and the various species of one "genus" may be in reality a heterogeneous
  assembly. Such an instance is probably the genus <i>Hylella</i>, of which four species live in the
  Andesian and Central American provinces, while the two others occur in New Guinea and
  Australia.</p>

  <p>The two North American genera <i>Chorophilus</i> and <i>Acris</i>, and the Brazilian
  <i>Thoropa</i>, connect the Hylidae with the Cystignathidae, in so far as their finger-discs are
  very small, or even <span class="pagenum" id="page187"><span
  class="smaller">{187}</span></span>absent, and their sacral diapophyses are only slightly dilated.
  On the other hand, it has to be emphasised that the possession of adhesive discs on the fingers
  and toes does not necessarily constitute a member of the Hylidae. That requires <i>the further
  combination of an arciferous sternum, with dilated sacral diapophyses and teeth in the upper
  jaw</i>. Finger-discs are easily developed, and still more easily lost. Those of the typical
  Hylidae are constructed as follows. The terminal phalanx is elongated, claw-shaped, swollen at its
  base. Between it and the penultimate phalanx lies an interphalangeal cartilaginous disc which
  projects ventrally below the end-phalanx, thus assisting the formation of the ventral pad, and the
  turning upwards of the whole disc-like phalanx like the claw of a cat. This peculiar motion can be
  well observed in Tree-frogs which are at rest upon a horizontal leaf, or, better still, upon a
  rough stone, when the creatures take good care to adjust their discs into a safe and easy
  position. The pad or disc itself is furnished with unstriped, smooth muscular fibres, the
  contraction of which produces one or more longitudinal furrows on the under side. When the disc is
  in action or adhering, being flattened to a smooth surface, the end-phalanx sinks into the
  cushion; when not in action, the cushion swells and the phalanx appears as a slight dorsal ridge.
  The disc is rich in lymph-spaces, and its surface contains mucilaginous glands.</p>

  <p>Various suggestions have been made to explain the function of these discs. Suction, adhesion,
  and glueing-on have been resorted to. Suction, through production of a vacuum, is quite imaginary
  and does not exist. The question has been thoroughly studied by Schuberg.<a id="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> Adhesion is due to the molecular attraction of two closely
  appressed bodies. The less air remains between them the stronger it is. Consequently it can be
  increased by the interference of a thin layer of fluid, which as everyday observation shows,
  possesses both adhesion and cohesion. The more sticky the fluid, the more effective it is, as
  shown experimentally by Schuberg, who moistened the under surface of a glass plate, and pressed it
  against a little disc of glass from which was suspended a weight. A disc of 16 square millimetres,
  approximately equal to the aggregate surface of the 18 discs of a European tree-frog of 4 grammes
  in weight, carried with water-adhesion <span class="pagenum" id="page188"><span
  class="smaller">{188}</span></span>no less than 14 grammes, with glycerine-solution 20
  grammes,&ndash;more than sufficient to suspend the frog. The sticky secretion of its glands
  greatly enhances the adhesive power. Tree-frogs, when hopping on to a vertical plane of clean
  glass, slide down a little, probably until the secretion stiffens, or dries into greater
  consistency. After a few days I find the glass-walls of their recently cleaned cage quite dirty,
  covered everywhere with their finger-marks. On the other hand, wet leaves or moist glass-walls
  afford no hold. The adhesion of these frogs is assisted in most cases by their soft and moist
  bellies, just as a dead frog will stick to a pane of glass.</p>

  <p>All Hylidae have a voice, often very loud, and enhanced by vocal sacs, which are either
  internal, swelling out the throat, or external, paired or unpaired.</p>

  <p>The various Hylidae resort to all kinds of modes of rearing their broods. Most of them lay many
  eggs, up to one thousand, in the water, not coherent in strings but in clumps; others lay only a
  few, attach them to various parts of the body, or, as in the genus <i>Nototrema</i>, the female
  receives them in a dorsal pouch. These modifications will be described in connexion with the
  different species.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Amphignathodontinae.</b>&ndash;<i>Both upper and lower jaw with teeth.</i></p>

  <p><i>Amphignathodon</i>, of which only one species is known, <i>A. guentheri</i> of Ecuador,
  agrees with <i>Nototrema</i> in all important characters except that it possesses teeth in the
  lower jaw in addition to those in the upper. There are further differences, but they are of degree
  only. The sacral diapophyses are more strongly dilated and the omosternum is absent. The tympanum
  is distinct. The pupil is horizontal; the roundish tongue is slightly free behind. The terminal
  phalanges are claw-shaped and carry large discs. The female has a dorsal pouch opening backwards.
  The skin of the head is involved in the ossification of the cranial bones. The skin of the back is
  smooth, slightly tubercular, non-granular below. The middle of the upper eyelid carries a small,
  pointed, cutaneous appendage, and even this little character occurs also in some species of
  <i>Nototrema</i>, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>N. longipes</i> and in <i>N. cornutum</i>. The heel carries a
  triangular little flap. The upper parts are olive in spirit-specimens, probably green in life; the
  borders of the dorsal pouch <span class="pagenum" id="page189"><span
  class="smaller">{189}</span></span>are black. The sides of the body are adorned with a black,
  white-edged streak, the limbs are whitish, with black cross-bars. The total length of the female
  type-specimen is 3 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Hylinae.</b>&ndash;<i>Lower jaw toothless.</i></p>

  <p>The Hylinae are divided by Boulenger into 13 genera, which can be recognised by the following

  </div>

  <p><i>Hyla.</i>&ndash;The pupil is horizontal. The tympanum is distinct or hidden. The tongue is
  entire or slightly nicked in its hinder margin, which is more or less free behind. The fingers and
  toes are provided with typical adhesive discs.</p>

  <p>This is the largest genus of all Amphibia, containing about 150 species, and its distribution
  coincides with that of the whole family. Many of the species are very closely allied to each <span
  class="pagenum" id="page190"><span class="smaller">{190}</span></span>other, differing only in
  small points, for instance in the extent of the webs to the fingers and toes, the configuration of
  the vomerine teeth, the size and appearance of the tympanic disc, and the relative length of the
  hind-limbs. In some of the West Indian, and in one Brazilian species, <i>H. nigromaculata</i>, the
  upper surface of the head is rough, owing to the cutis being involved in the cranial ossification.
  Bony or perhaps only calcareous deposits in other parts of the skin are rare, but are notably
  developed in <i>H. dasynotus</i> of Brazil, in which they extend from the head to the sacrum,
  rendering the skin immovable.</p>

  <p>Many are capable of changing colour to a great extent, and it is a popular error to suppose
  that all tree-frogs are green, although this colour is perhaps the most common in the arboreal
  kinds.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 37.</span>&ndash;<i>Hyla arborea</i>, var.
      <i>meridionalis</i>. South European Tree-frog, &times; 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>H. arborea.</i>&ndash;The tongue is rather round, slightly nicked behind, and can be
  protruded but little. The tympanum is distinct, but small. The upper parts are grass-green, quite
  smooth and shiny owing to the skin being covered with a film of moisture; the under parts are
  yellowish-white and granular, flesh-coloured or rosy on the thighs. Total length of large females
  2 inches. This, the Tree-frog of Europe, has an enormous range, namely, from Morocco, France, and
  the south of Sweden, across the whole of Europe and Asia Minor to Japan and Southern China.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page191"><span class="smaller">{191}</span></span></div>

  <p>Several varieties have been described: the <i>typical</i> or <i>European form</i> is ornamented
  with a narrow black stripe, which, beginning at the nose, extends backwards along the side of the
  body to the groin, where it generally forms a hook turned upwards. This black colour forms the
  ventral boundary of the green, and is itself narrowly seamed with white on its upper border.</p>

  <p>In the south of France, the Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, and the Canary Islands the black
  lateral stripe is often absent; this is the var. <i>meridionalis</i>. In Spain and Portugal both
  forms are found in the same localities.</p>

  <p>In the Asiatic, chiefly in the eastern specimens, the lateral stripes tend to break up into
  irregular spots, vanishing altogether towards the groins; this var. <i>savignyi</i> s.
  <i>japonica</i> occurs also on most of the Mediterranean islands.</p>

  <p><i>H. arborea</i> can change colour to a great extent, mostly in adaptation to its immediate
  surroundings, but ill health and moulting may also influence it. The change is slow. The usual
  colour is green, brightest on bright, sunny hot days, dull when the sky is overcast, or when it is
  windy and showery. Day and night have no influence upon the colour-changes. The hue of the green
  agrees mostly with that of the foliage on which the frog happens to take its rest, for instance a
  field of Indian corn, birch-trees, or oak-trees. I once received a consignment from Saxony. When
  the box with moss was unpacked, they were of the dullest greenish-grey; they were put into a
  wired-off corner of the yard and were given the freshly cut branches of a lime-tree to sit upon.
  On the following morning I at first looked for most of the frogs in vain. The leaves had withered
  and all those frogs which sat upon the dark brown branches had put on a light brown garb, mottled
  with darker patches.</p>

  <p>Another specimen, one of several which were at liberty in a greenhouse, took to resting on the
  frame of the window-pane, in a corner where putty, glass, and discoloured white paint met; in the
  morning it was always of a mottled leaden colour, but during the nocturnal hunting it was green.
  In the winter, the window-corner being of course cold, the frog remained stationary for several
  months, but kept the leaden grey colour, until one day in the early spring it was mottled with
  green, and soon after it joined its green mates.</p>

  <p>Liebe observed a half grown tree-frog which he kept in Gera <span class="pagenum"
  id="page192"><span class="smaller">{192}</span></span>during the winter in a glass with
  water-cress. While the temperature was near freezing the frog sat in the water, very lethargic,
  breathing perhaps once every quarter of an hour. Its colour was light green. When the water-cress
  was cut and removed, the frog darkened and became at last quite a discoloured grey. When the
  water-cress was put back, the creature reassumed the light yellowish-green colour, remaining in
  its lethargic condition until it became lively in the spring sunshine.</p>

  <p>The European tree-frog spends most of its time in the summer, after the pairing is over, in
  trees, often in the very crowns; but the neighbourhood of even a small patch of Indian corn has
  still greater attractions. There are all sorts of green insects to be caught, there are fair
  chances of coming across the common Cabbage White, a butterfly which the tree-frog loves, and last
  not least the large luscious leaves afford a firm foothold, and the axillae between stalk and
  broad-based leaves are just the places for the frog to slip into, where nobody can find it. During
  the day they mostly sit still, on the keen look-out for passing insects, which, when they settle
  within reach, are jumped at; otherwise they have first to be stalked. The jump is quite fearless,
  regardless of the height above ground; there is the leaf upon which the prey sits, and even if
  this leaf be missed, there are others, and one of them is sure to be struck by some of the discs
  of either fingers or toes. If the fall is broken by the toes, and the new leaf or branch is very
  elastic and bends down, then there are some frantic antics to be gone through until the frog has
  settled itself again. Then the large blue-bottle, or the butterfly, is devoured at leisure, wings
  and all being poked in with the assistance of the little hands. But the real hunting-time is the
  night.</p>

  <p>During a shower the frog shifts its position to the under side of the leaf, or into a less
  slippery position, and during continuous wet it descends into the grass, or it takes to the water.
  Its greatest enemy is the Grass Snake, which prefers it to anything else, not minding the
  poisonous secretion of the skin, which is sharp enough to produce sneezing or even temporary
  blindness when incautiously brought into the human eye.</p>

  <p>The male has an internal vocal sac, which, when inflated, bulges out the whole throat into a
  globe, much larger than the head. The voice is a sharp and rapidly-repeated note, something <span
  class="pagenum" id="page193"><span class="smaller">{193}</span></span>like "epp-epp-epp," or
  "creck, creck, creck," with more or less of an <i>a</i> sound. It is uttered at any time of the
  day, more frequently at dusk, and of course chiefly during the pairing season. This tree-frog
  suffers from the reputation of being a good weather-prophet, and it is for this reason often kept
  in confinement, the orthodox abode being a muslin-covered glass jar, with a hole to put flies
  through, water and plants at the bottom, and a little ladder to sit upon. The prophesying is of
  the usual popular unreliable nature, although the little creature, provided it is a male, often
  sounds its voice on the approach of a shower, or when there is a thunderstorm in the air. During
  continuous fine weather it sits on the top of the ladder, or is glued on near the rim of the
  glass, while on wet and dull days it is less active, and may keep nearer the ground or in the
  water. There is a German rhyme which well expresses the prophet's reliability by its
  ambiguity:&ndash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Wenn die Laubfr&ouml;sche knarren,</p>
    <p>Magst du auf Regen harren.</p>
  </div>

  <p>When the tree-frogs croak, you may wait for rain. Sometimes it does come true.</p>

  <p>Tree-frogs are not very intelligent, although they have a keen sense of locality; but they are
  nice pets, being easily kept, and have a pretty appearance. There is a record of one which lived
  for twenty-two years in confinement.</p>

  <p>The pairing begins soon after the frogs reappear from their hibernation in the ground; in
  Germany in the month of May. The congregating males make a great noise and take to the water
  before the females, which join them when ready to spawn. The male grasps his mate near the
  shoulders, and the pair swim about together, sometimes for days, until the eggs are expelled.
  These are laid in small clumps of 800 to 1000, which soon swell up and remain at the bottom of the
  pond. The larvae are hatched in ten days; two days later the adhesive sucker below the throat
  appears, and after another two days a pair of thread-like external gills are developed. The
  tadpoles, which reach a length of 2 inches, owing to the long tail, which is nearly three times as
  long as the body, metamorphose in about twelve weeks, and the baby tree-frogs, scarcely half an
  inch in length, hide in the grass for the next two years, until they are about half grown, not
  reaching maturity until the fourth year.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page194"><span class="smaller">{194}</span></span></div>

  <p>Since many pairs congregate in the same pool, and each produces up to one thousand eggs, most
  of which are hatched, the neighbouring meadows sometimes literally swarm with tiny tree-frogs.
  Nevertheless the adults are comparatively rare and are very local.</p>

  <p><i>H. carolinensis</i> s. <i>lateralis</i> of the South-Eastern States of North America greatly
  resembles <i>H. arborea</i> in general appearance, size, and habits. But the head is more pointed,
  and the vivid green of the upper parts is separated from the yellowish white under surface by a
  conspicuous, pure white line, giving the little creature a very smart and neat appearance.
  According to Holbrook, it ascends trees, but most commonly lies upon broad-leaved water-plants,
  like <i>Nymphaea</i>, and in fields of Indian corn. Motionless during the daytime, they emerge in
  the morning and evening from their hiding-places, and become very brisk and noisy, often repeating
  their single note, which is not unlike that of a small bell. When one begins, hundreds take it up
  from all parts of the corn-field.</p>

  <p>Among other tree-frogs of the South-Eastern States may be mentioned <i>H. squirella</i>, 1&frac12;
  inch in length, which is very changeable in colour, generally olive above with darker spots and
  bars on the limbs, and with a white upper lip. It lives in trees, sheltering in the bark. <i>H.
  femoralis</i> of the same size, without the white lip, lives high up in the trees of the dense
  forests of Georgia and Carolina.</p>

  <p><i>H. versicolor</i> is one of the most delicately coloured species of Eastern North America,
  extending northwards into Canada. It is about 2 inches long. Its colour passes within a short time
  from dark brown or olive grey to pale delicate grey, almost white, occasionally retaining a few
  large darker patches on the back, and delicate cross-bars on the limbs. A small portion of the
  sides and the posterior part of the belly are bright yellow. The skin is granular, owing to the
  presence of small warts which produce an acrid secretion. It is said to be found in trees, or
  about old stone fences overgrown with lichens, the colour of which it resembles to perfection. It
  becomes very noisy towards the evening, in cloudy weather or before rain, the voice consisting of
  a liquid note, terminating abruptly, like "l-l-l-l-luk." My own captives fully bear out this
  statement of Holbrook's. Settled motionless during the day upon a piece of bark in a shady <span
  class="pagenum" id="page195"><span class="smaller">{195}</span></span>corner, but occasionally
  uttering the quaint and rather faint note, they become very lively in the evening, catching
  insects by long jumps, or investigating the hollows of decaying mossy stumps. Their general colour
  is then spotless, almost silvery grey. In the day-time they are sometimes suffused with delicate
  green.</p>

  <p>The propagation has been studied by Miss M. H. Hinckley.<a id="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> They pair in shallow pools, in Massachusetts, in May. On the
  10th of that month eggs were attached singly, and in groups, on the grasses resting upon the
  surface of the water; first drab-coloured, they became lighter in a few hours. Some larvae escaped
  from the gelatinous envelopes on the following day, the others on the third day; they clung to the
  grasses by means of their prominent suckers. The head and body were cream-coloured, with olive
  dots, and averaged &frac14; inch in length. Gills appeared on the fourth day, to disappear again during
  the four following days, first those of the right, then those of the left, side; the suckers
  became less conspicuous, and the general colour turned into deep olive-green, with fine golden
  dots on the upper and lower surfaces. The eyes were of a brilliant flame-colour. On the eleventh
  day the suckers or "holders" had disappeared, and the hind-limbs were indicated by small white
  buds. By June 5th, <i>i.e.</i> the twenty-seventh day, the toes developed the terminal discs; the
  mottling of gold had given way to a uniform olive or pea-green. Movements of the future arms
  beneath the skin appeared on the 28th of June, at the age of seven weeks. The arms, mostly the
  right one first, were thrust out on the 2nd of July; the fins of the tail were absorbed rapidly,
  and towards the end of the seventh week the nearly transformed creatures began to leave the water.
  The young frogs changed colour rapidly, in adaptation to their surroundings, but the four
  specimens which survived were never all found to be of the same colour during the next three
  months. They first lived upon Aphides, later upon flies, and they were alert nocturnally. About
  the beginning of October they left the fronds of their fernery and nestled away in the damp earth,
  which they left only when the temperature rose above 60&deg; F.</p>

  <p><i>H. vasta</i> of Hayti is the giant of the tree-frogs, reaching a length of 5 inches. In
  order to support its great weight the <span class="pagenum" id="page196"><span
  class="smaller">{196}</span></span>adhesive discs of the fingers and toes are of a surprising
  size, about as large as a threepenny piece. The skin is covered with small warts, and forms a
  peculiar fold on the hinder surface of the fore-arm and on the tarsus, and small flaps near the
  vent. The colour is grey above, blackish on the head, with a brown band between the eyes; the
  under parts are flesh-coloured, the throat with black spots.</p>

  <p><i>H. maxima</i>, of the forests of British Guiana, is scarcely less gigantic, and is
  distinguished by a projecting rudiment of the pollex, while the adhesive discs are smaller than
  the tympanum. The skin forms folds on the arms and tarsus, like those of <i>H. vasta</i>, in
  addition to a triangular flap at the heel. The general colour is reddish-brown above, sometimes
  with a dark vertebral line, the under parts are whitish and covered with large granules; the
  throat of the male, which has an inner vocal sac, is brown.</p>

  <p><i>H. faber</i> of Brazil is closely allied to the last species, but the skin of its upper
  parts is quite smooth. There is a small tarsal fold, and one extending from the upper eyelid to
  the shoulder. It is light brown above, with darker marks which form a conspicuous vertebral line,
  transverse bars on the hind-limbs, and a few irregular, scattered, vermicular or linear marks on
  the head and body. The adult, when put into a strong light, will rapidly turn pale; at night the
  longitudinal stripe on the back and the bars on the hind-limbs become very distinct; the under
  parts are white, and exhibit a beautiful orange tinge. This is the famous "<i>Ferreiro</i>" or
  "smith." As will be seen from the following graphic account by Dr. Goeldi<a id="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> of Para, this species doubly deserves its name of <i>faber</i>,
  not only in virtue of its voice, but also because of the marvellous nest-building habits recently
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Ferreiro</i> is common in the Province Rio de Janeiro, more frequently still in the
  mountain regions of the Serra dos Org&atilde;os than in the hot lowland. Its voice is one of the most
  characteristic sounds to be heard in tropical South America. Fancy the noise of a mallet, slowly
  and regularly beaten upon a copper plate, and you will have a pretty good idea of the concert,
  given generally by several individuals at the same time and with slight variations in tone and
  intensity. When you approach the <span class="pagenum" id="page197"><span
  class="smaller">{197}</span></span>spot where the Tree-frog sits, the sound ceases. But keep
  quiet, and it will be resumed after a few moments. You will discover the frog on a grass-stem, on
  a leaf of a low branch, or in the mud. Seize it quickly, for it is a most wonderful jumper, and it
  will utter a loud and shrill, most startling cry, somewhat similar to that of a wounded cat."</p>

  <p>The "Smith" makes very regular pools, in the shallow water of ponds, or nurseries for the
  tadpoles surrounded by a circular wall of mud. Dr. Goeldi has watched the building process during
  a moonlit night: "We soon saw a mass of mud rising to the surface carried by a Tree-frog, of which
  no more than the two hands emerged. Diving again, after a moment's time, the frog brought up a
  second mass of mud, near the first. This was repeated many times, the result being the gradual
  erection of a circular wall. From time to time the builder's head and front part of body appeared
  suddenly with a load of mud on some opposite point. But what astonished us in the highest degree
  was the manner in which it used its hands for smoothing the inside of the mud wall, as would a
  mason with his trowel. When the height of the wall reached about 4 inches, the frog was obliged to
  get out of the water. The parapet of the wall receives the same careful smoothing, but the outside
  is neglected. The levelling of the bottom is obtained by the action of the lower surface (belly
  and throat principally) together with that of the hands."</p>

  <p>The male takes no active share in the construction of the nest, but will suddenly climb up the
  wall of his home, and then upon the back of his busy mate. The building operation may take one or
  two nights, and is performed in the most absolute silence; the croakers around are all males
  clamouring for a mate.</p>

  <p>The eggs are laid during one of the following nights, and are hatched some four or five days
  later, the parents keeping hidden in the neighbourhood of the nursery. Heavy rains may destroy the
  walls, and thus prematurely release the tadpoles.</p>

  <p>It is only owing to such keen observers and lovers of nature's fascinating ways that the
  breeding habits of some Brazilian Hylidae have become known.</p>

  <p><i>H. nebulosa</i> s. <i>luteola</i> also living in Brazil, is yellow above, with brown dots;
  the sides of the belly and thighs have <span class="pagenum" id="page198"><span
  class="smaller">{198}</span></span>transverse bluish bars, the under parts are whitish. Its size
  is under 2 inches. Goeldi has often found it in the sheaths of decaying banana-leaves. It glues
  the lumps of eggs on to the edges and to the inside of the withered leaves, where even during the
  hot hours of the day sufficient coolness and moisture are preserved. These lumps are enveloped in
  a frothy substance, in which the nearly metamorphosed tadpoles can be watched wriggling. If these
  are put into water, all will die in a few hours.</p>

  <p><i>H. polytaenia</i> deposits its eggs in free lumpy masses on water-plants. It is a small
  creature, little more than 1 inch in length, light olive above, with numerous brown parallel
  longitudinal bands on the body and limbs. A dark, white-edged band extends from the nose along the
  side of the body. The heel has a short flap of skin. The male has an internal vocal sac.</p>

  <p><i>H. goeldii</i> is a most interesting form, leading to the allied genus <i>Nototrema</i>.
  Boulenger<a id="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> has described a female which was
  captured by Goeldi in January on the Serra dos Org&atilde;os. It is about 1&frac12; inch long. The whole surface
  of the back is occupied by a layer of twenty-six pale yellow eggs which are 4 mm. in diameter. The
  skin of the back is expanded into a feebly reverted fold, which borders and supports the mass of
  eggs on the sides, thus suggesting an incipient stage of a dorsal brood-pouch. Owing to the great
  amount of yolk, the young are probably able to remain upon the mother until they are nearly
  metamorphosed.</p>

  <p><i>H. coerulea</i> s. <i>cyanea</i> is one of the largest Australian green tree-frogs, ranging
  from the South to the very North of Australia. The discs are as large as the fully-exposed
  tympanum. There is no projecting rudiment of the pollex, but a slight cutaneous fold borders the
  inner side of the tarsus. The skin is smooth and shiny, always a little moist, and studded with
  numerous rather large pores on the nape and shoulders; this somewhat thickened region forms a
  prominent fold which begins behind the eyes. The belly and the under parts of the thighs are
  granular as in most Hylidae. The male has an internal vocal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span>sac; and during the breeding season, which
  seems to occur during our autumn and winter, develops brown rugosities on the inner side of the
  first finger. The tongue is round, slightly notched behind and free enough to be protruded a
  little.</p>

  <p>The alternative specific names are most unfortunately chosen, as they apply only to
  spirit-specimens. During life this tree-frog exhibits a considerable amount of colour-changes. The
  normal colour is bright green above, white below. A conspicuous feature of this species is the
  frequent occurrence of white specks or spots, which are probably due to the deposition of guanine,
  a peculiar white colouring matter. The spots appear in any part of the green skin, and are quite
  irregular in their distribution. Sometimes they remain for weeks in the same place, or they
  disappear after a few days and others appear. They are in no way connected with the shedding of
  the skin, nor do they indicate ill-health. <i>H. coerulea</i> lives well in confinement, and
  becomes tame enough to take food from one's fingers, even when sitting upon the hand. Some of mine
  took to living during the daytime in a small box, preferring a crowded condition in companionship
  with <span class="pagenum" id="page200"><span class="smaller">{200}</span></span>Natterjacks.
  Others squeeze themselves into the most uncomfortable cracks, while others again prefer the broad
  leaves of <i>Philodendron</i>. A favourite place for two or three at a time is the funnel-shaped
  spaces formed by <i>Bromelia</i>-plants. Those specimens which are hidden in the box or in the
  hollows of rotten stumps are, almost without exception, dull, very dark brownish olive, while
  those on the Bromelias assume exactly the sombre dull green of its leaves. Lastly, those which sit
  in the light, exposed places, no matter if upon a leaf, on a white stone, or upon a board, are
  emerald-green, especially beautiful on hot, sunny days;&ndash;and they are not always averse to
  the full glare of the sun. When squatting upon a flat surface, such as a broad leaf, they tuck the
  fore-paws under the head like a cat, and with half open eyelids, the pupil contracted to a tiny
  slit, so that the golden iris is exposed, they remain motionless during the day. They take food
  when offered, but at night they roam about, either hopping on the ground, or making enormous leaps
  from leaf to leaf, sometimes deliberately stalking some choice insect, and patiently climbing up a
  stem, hand over hand. At night their whole aspect is changed. The colour is saturated green, the
  eyes are transformed into round, projecting shiny black beads, and the head is erect. The
  ludicrously dreamy, complacent look has given way to wide-awake alertness. They take all kinds of
  living food. When they find an earthworm, they first look at it, bending the head sharply down,
  lift themselves upon the fore-limbs and then pounce upon it, nipping the prey with the jaws, and
  then poking it down deliberately with the hands. Cockroaches are simply lapped up, and disappear
  in the twinkle of an eye. Mealworms, wood-lice, butterflies and moths, flies and spiders are
  taken. The stomach of a specimen in the Dresden Museum, from the Aru Islands, contained some four
  or five young freshwater Crustaceans of the genus <i>Sesarma</i>. They fortunately do not molest
  smaller frogs of their own kind and of other species. Like many Amphibia they like a change of
  diet, and ultimately refuse their food if it is unvaried. To my surprise my largest specimen,
  which measures a little more than 4 inches, takes snails, <i>Helix virgata</i>, half-a-dozen at a
  time, and on the following day, not during the night, vomits the sucked-out shells in a lump, like
  the pellets of birds of prey. During this rather painful-looking procedure the whole tongue and
  about half an <span class="pagenum" id="page201"><span class="smaller">{201}</span></span>inch of
  the everted gullet are protruded out of the mouth, and are then slowly withdrawn. After having
  roamed about all night, they return to their respective resting-places, where each individual is
  sure to be found in exactly the same spot, day after day. They do not mind being looked at, but if
  taken up and put back they avoid that place for perhaps a week, taking shelter somewhere else.</p>

  <p>Both sexes have a voice, but that of the female is only a grunting noise, while the male
  inflates its gular sac and sends forth a sharp cracking sound, which can turn into a regular
  bellowing like the gruff barking of an angry dog. They bellow at any time of the year, frequently
  on the approach of a shower or during a thunderstorm. Certain noises will also induce them to
  bark. The rattling produced by the syringing of the greenhouse, sawing of wood, hammering, the
  raking of the gravel, or even the scraping of boots on the gravel-path is liable to start one of
  the males, and the others are sure to chime in.</p>

  <p>According to Fletcher, <i>H. coerulea</i> and <i>H. aurea</i> lay their eggs in round white
  frothy patches, which float in the water, chiefly during the months of August and September; but
  when the spring months are very dry, the pairing is delayed until the following January. Several
  other Australian species of <i>Hyla</i>, e.g. <i>H. ewingi</i>, spawn at any time of the year if
  the conditions are favourable. They attach their eggs to submerged blades of grass or to
  twigs.</p>

  <p><i>H. aurea</i> is one of the commonest and most beautiful species, occurring throughout
  Australia and Tasmania, excepting of course in the large deserts. It has the appearance and
  restlessness of a water-frog, is not unlike <i>Rana esculenta</i>, and grows to about three inches
  in length. The tympanum is very distinct, but rather small. The fingers are without a
  pollex-rudiment, the tarsus has a fold along its inner edge. The adhesive discs are decidedly
  small. The male has two internal vocal sacs, which bulge out sideways. The skin is smooth and
  shiny. The under parts are white; the upper parts are, speaking generally, a mixture of blue and
  olive, with blue or brown spots, but spirit-specimens give no idea of the beauty which this
  changeable species can assume. Sometimes the same individual is saturated blue and green, with
  several longitudinal stripes of burnished copper along the back; a few minutes later the stripes
  glitter <span class="pagenum" id="page202"><span class="smaller">{202}</span></span>like gold, and
  in other moods the whole upper surface is mottled blue, green, and brown. My specimens often went
  into the water and did not climb. The food is said to consist chiefly of other small frogs in
  preference to insects.</p>

  <p><i>Nototrema</i> differs from <i>Hyla</i> in so far as the female has a pouch on the back for
  the reception of the eggs. This bag is formed by an infolding of the skin; it opens backwards in
  front of the vent, it has a sphincter and is permanent, although it distends to larger dimensions
  when in use. An initial stage of such a pouch is possessed by <i>Hyla goeldii</i> (Fig. 38). The
  pupil is horizontal, the tongue can be protruded but little; the tympanum is free, and the
  adhesive discs of the fingers and toes are well developed. These "marsupial frogs," of which about
  half-a-dozen species are known, live chiefly in the tropical forest-region of South America,
  notably from Peru to Venezuela.</p>

  <p><i>N. marsupiatum</i> is green with darker blue-green spots, or with longitudinal patches which
  are each surrounded by a whitish or yellow seam of little dots. The limbs have cross-bars. Total
  length about 2&frac12; to 3 inches. The eggs of this species are comparatively small and numerous. The
  very small tadpoles have no external gills, and escape from the pouch to finish their
  metamorphosis in the water.</p>

  <p><i>N. testudineum</i>, about 3 inches in length, is of a uniform lead-colour, but is lighter
  beneath. The skin of the back is studded with stellate calcareous deposits, a peculiarity which is
  alluded to in the specific name.</p>

  <p><i>N. oviferum</i> is brown above, with darker patches on the sides of the body and with
  cross-bars on the limbs. The last two species and <i>N. fissipes</i> of Brazil, near Pernambuco,
  carry their young in the pouch until the metamorphosis is completed. This long nursing-period
  necessitates a great amount of food-yolk in the eggs, and this enlargement in turn implies a
  considerable reduction in their number. The female's load consists of about fifteen eggs only, but
  these are of a great size, namely one-eighth of the length of the mother's body.</p>

  <p><i>N. pygmaeum</i>, in Venezuela, is a tiny creature. The female, just one inch in length,
  carries only from four to seven eggs. It looks then "as if it carried a sac filled with a few
  gigantic balls." This species is further worthy of note on account of the opening of the
  brood-pouch, which is a longitudinal slit, whence a kind <span class="pagenum" id="page203"><span
  class="smaller">{203}</span></span>of thin and slightly elevated ridge or fold of the skin extends
  on to the neck. The suggestion, that this seam is burst open, in order to set the full-grown young
  free, instead of their passing through the existing opening, is scarcely credible.</p>

  <p>These Neotropical tree-frogs seem to be rare, and females with embryos are of course still more
  uncommon, so that the best account of their structure is still that given by Weinland<a
  id="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> of <i>N. oviferum</i>. How the eggs get into the
  pouch has not yet been observed, but it is most likely with the help of the male, immediately
  after fertilisation. The pouch forms two blind sacs which extend forwards over the sides of the
  back. The eggs are large, 1 cm. in diameter, and the enclosed embryos, or rather tadpoles, had a
  length of 15 mm., with a large amount of yolk still contained in the spirally wound intestine. The
  first two gill-arches carried each a double thread, which expanded into a funnel-shaped membrane,
  not unlike the flower of a <i>Convolvulus</i>, and furnished with a capillary network; the stalk
  contained muscular fibres. These most peculiar structures are of course the much modified external
  gills. Those of <i>N. testudineum</i> and <i>N. cornutum</i> are likewise bell-shaped.</p>

  <p><i>Hylella</i> differs from <i>Hyla</i> chiefly by the absence of vomerine teeth, and consists
  of about half-a-dozen small species, about one inch in length. The fact that two species live in
  Queensland and New Guinea, while the others are natives of tropical America, suggests that this
  genus is not a natural but an artificial assembly, an instance of convergent evolution.</p>

  <p><i>Phyllomedusa</i>, composed of about one dozen species of tree-frogs, is characterised by the
  vertically contracted pupil, large adhesive discs, and the opposable nature of the inner finger
  and of the hallux, the last joints of which are like thumbs. The sacral diapophyses are strongly
  dilated. The range of the genus extends from tropical Central America to Buenos Aires. Most of the
  species are about 2 inches in length, blue-green to violet above, with white purple-edged patches
  on the sides of the body; the under parts uniform white, or with purple or brown patches. The male
  has a subgular vocal sac. Some have more or less distinct parotoid glands. <i>Ph. dacnicolor</i>
  of Mexico is uniform green above, whitish below, and attains a size of more than 3 inches. In
  <i>Ph. bicolor</i> of Brazil, the skin of the upper <span class="pagenum" id="page204"><span
  class="smaller">{204}</span></span>parts is studded with calcareous deposits, and the parotoids
  are large. It is blue-green above, purplish white below, the sides of the body and limbs with
  white purple-edged spots.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. hypochondrialis</i> has been found breeding freely in the Paraguayan Chaco by Budgett,<a
  id="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> from whose account the following notes have been
  extracted. This brilliantly coloured frog is green above, which colour may become brown-grey or
  bluish at will; below, white and granular. The flanks are scarlet, with black transverse bars, and
  the plantar surfaces are deep purplish black. Total length about 1&frac12; inch.</p>

  <p>The "Wollunnkukk," as it is called by the Indians, from the call of both male and female at
  pairing time, is extremely slow in its movements, and is active only at night. At this time, if it
  is seen by the aid of a lantern as it slowly climbs over the low bushes and grass, it is very
  conspicuous. In the daytime, however, nothing is seen but the upper surface of the body as it lies
  on the green leaf of a plant. It has a remarkable power of changing its colour to harmonise with
  its surroundings, and can effect a change from the brightest green to light chocolate in a few
  minutes. The skin is also directly sensitive to light; for if the frog is exposed to the sun while
  in a tuft of grass in such a way that shadows of blades of grass fall across it, on removal it
  will be found that dark shadows of the grasses remain on the skin, while the general colour has
  been raised to a lighter shade. Its food consists largely of young locusts. The ovaries on each
  side are divided into five distinct clusters. The rectum has a large saccular diverticulum, which
  is very heavily pigmented.</p>

  <p>In the breeding season&ndash;December to February&ndash;this beautiful frog collects in
  considerable numbers in the neighbourhood of pools. During the night-time they call incessantly to
  one another, and produce a sound as of a dozen men breaking stones, well imitated by the native
  name.</p>

  <p>The eggs are enclosed in batches in leaves near the margin of the water. Budgett has been able
  to watch the whole process of oviposition and fertilisation. He found, at 11 <span
  class="smaller">P.M.</span>, a female carrying a male upon her back, wandering about in search of
  a suitable leaf. At last the female, climbing up the stem of a plant near the water's edge,
  reached out and caught hold of the <span class="pagenum" id="page205"><span
  class="smaller">{205}</span></span>tip of an overhanging leaf, and climbed into it. Both male and
  female held the edges of the leaf together, near the tip, with their hind-legs, while the female
  poured her eggs into the funnel thus formed, the male fertilising them as they passed. The jelly
  in which the eggs were laid was of sufficient firmness to hold the edges of the leaf together.
  Then moving up a little further, more eggs were laid in the same manner, the edges of the leaf
  being fastened together by the hind-legs, and so on up the leaf until it was full. As a rule, two
  briar-leaves were filled in this way, each containing about 100 eggs. The time occupied in filling
  one leaf was three-quarters of an hour.</p>

  <p>Development proceeds rapidly. Within six days the embryo increases from the 2 mm. of the
  egg-diameter to 9 or 10 mm. When it leaves the leaf it is a transparent glass-like tadpole, whose
  only conspicuous parts are the eyes. These are very large and of a bright metallic green colour,
  so that when swimming in the water all that is seen is a pair of jewel-like eyes. The
  newly-hatched tadpole has also a bright metallic spot between the nostrils somewhat in front of
  the pineal spot. This is the point which touches the surface of the water when the tadpole is in
  its favourite position. Whether it is a protective coloration, or some mechanical arrangement for
  holding the surface, Budgett could not make out.</p>

  <p>The egg contains a great amount of yolk; the rest of the jelly-like contents of the egg becomes
  fluid, so that towards the end of embryonic life the larva comes to lie quite freely within a
  membranous capsule. The external gills appear on the third day, and reach their greatest size on
  the fifth, when these bright red filamentous organs extend beyond the vent. By the time the
  tadpoles are ready to be hatched these gills have quite disappeared, there is a median spiracle,
  and the lungs are shining through the transparent body-wall. Five weeks later, <i>i.e.</i> six
  weeks after the eggs were laid, the tadpole is 8 cm. long, glossy green above, rosy and silvery
  below, and the hind-limbs protrude. The young frog at the close of its metamorphosis is two-thirds

  <p>The first account of the breeding of <i>Phyllomedusa</i> was given by v. Ihering<a id="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> concerning <i>Ph. iheringi</i> of Southern Brazil.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page206"><span class="smaller">{206}</span></span></div>

  <p>"<i>Phyllomedusa</i> does not lay its eggs in the water, although the larva develops in that
  element, but in the open air in masses 50 millim. long by 15-20 broad, between leaves hanging over
  the water. Willows are frequently used for that purpose. The egg-mass contains rather large white
  ova, wrapped up between two or three leaves in such a way as to be completely enveloped save an
  inferior opening. My attempts at rearing the eggs failed owing to the leaves drying up; but I am
  assured that the tailed larvae may be seen wriggling in the gelatinous mass. As at a later period
  the latter is found empty, we must infer that the larvae drop into the water below. The eggs are
  found only on plants hanging over stagnant water."</p>

  <p>"The adult animal is a stupid creature, and will let itself be taken without attempting to
  escape. Their moderately loud voice resembles somewhat the sound produced by running the finger
  nail over the teeth of a comb. Only during the breeding season, in the month of January in Rio
  Grande do Sul, do these frogs make their appearance; at other times not one is to be seen,
  probably because they establish themselves high up in the trees."</p>

  <p><i>Agalychnis</i>, with two species in Central America, is practically like <i>Hyla</i>; but
  the pupil is vertical, and the tongue is extensively free behind.</p>

  <p><i>Nyctimantis</i> differs from either by its round tongue, which is not nicked behind, and is
  almost completely adherent, much resembling that of the Discoglossidae. The sacral diapophyses are
  but slightly dilated. The only species, <i>N. rugiceps</i>, lives in Ecuador, and grows to nearly
  three inches in length. The head is large and rough owing to the skin being involved in the
  cranial ossification. It is further peculiar in its coloration, the under parts being
  chestnut-brown instead of whitish. The upper parts are olive-grey or brown.</p>

  <p>The following four genera, each represented by one or two species <span class="pagenum"
  id="page207"><span class="smaller">{207}</span></span>only, much resemble each other in the
  curious shape of the head, which forms a flat projecting snout, used probably for digging in
  rotten wood in search of insects. There is a peculiar degradation in the extent of dentition of
  the palatal region. <i>Diaglena</i> and <i>Triprion</i> are the only Hylidae which possess a
  longitudinal row of parasphenoid teeth. <i>Diaglena petasata</i> of Mexico and <i>D. jordani</i>
  of Ecuador have, moreover, a transverse row of teeth on the palatine bones in addition to those on
  the vomer.</p>

  <p><i>Triprion petasatus</i> of Yucatan has parasphenoid and vomerine teeth. The head is a bony
  casque, with strong superciliary ridges, the skin being extensively ossified. The mouth forms a
  flat snout, owing to the long projection of the upper over the lower jaw. The skin of the back is
  smooth brown with darker spots; the under parts are uniform whitish. The male has a subgular vocal
  sac. Like <i>Diaglena</i> and <i>Corythomantis</i> they possess adhesive discs on the fingers and
  toes, and climb trees. The total length of this curious creature is 2 inches.</p>

  <p><i>Corythomantis greeningi</i> of Brazil has a similar head. The vomers alone carry teeth,
  besides of course the maxillae. The pupil is rhomboid. The tongue, as in the two previous genera,
  is roundish, scarcely free. General colour above olive, with darker freckles; the sides are
  studded with whitish tubercles; the under parts are whitish. The male is devoid of vocal sacs.
  Total length 3 inches.</p>

  <p><i>Pternohyla fodiens</i> of Mexico approaches the previous three genera by the curious shape
  of the head and prominent upper jaw, although these features are not so exaggerated. The dentition
  agrees with that of <i>Corythomantis</i> and other normal tree-frogs. The fingers and toes are not
  provided with discs, in conformity with the burrowing, not climbing, habits of this creature. The
  next following three genera connect the Hylidae with the Cystignathidae. The sacral vertebrae are
  but slightly dilated.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Acris.</i>&ndash;The adhesive discs are very small, the tympanum is indistinct. <i>A.
  gryllus</i>, the only species, inhabits the greater part of Eastern and Central North America,
  extending northwards into Canada. It attains a length of 1&frac12; inch. The coloration is very
  changeable, in adaptation to the surroundings. As <span class="pagenum" id="page208"><span
  class="smaller">{208}</span></span>a rule it is brown, with a more or less reddish or grey
  ground-tone, ornamented with dark brown or blackish irregular, longitudinal patches,one of which
  is bordered with light green,and there is often a light vertebral streak. The legs are
  cross-barred, the under parts are whitish brown and yellowish. The male has a subgular vocal sac,
  and its most remarkable feature is the voice, which closely resembles the noise of a cricket or of
  certain grasshoppers. Holbrook describes it as a merry little frog, constantly chirping like a
  cricket, even in confinement. It frequents the borders of pools, and is often found on the leaves
  of aquatic plants, rarely on the branches of such low shrubs as overhang or dip into the water.
  When disturbed it takes long jumps, and hides at the bottom of the pond. Insects are secured by
  leaps. It can easily be domesticated, and takes food readily from the hand. Sprinkling them with
  water never fails to make them more lively and noisy. Appearing in April in great numbers, they
  are said to vanish early in the autumn for hibernation. The tadpoles are metamorphosed by the end
  of August.</p>

  <p><i>Chorophilus.</i>&ndash;The fingers and toes are provided with very small adhesive discs. The
  sacral diapophyses are very slightly dilated. About seven species occur in North America, chiefly
  in the Southern States, one, <i>Ch. cuzcanus</i>, in Peru. <i>Ch. ocularis</i> is the smallest of
  the frog-kind known, and lives in South Carolina, frequenting damp places, the vicinity of
  stagnant pools, water-plants or low shrubs, for instance the "myrtle," <i>Myrica cerifera</i>. I
  once had two of these tiny creatures less than three-quarters of an inch in length. They were very
  active, and took surprisingly long leaps, jumping distances of 2 feet, but could not be kept
  through the winter, although they took minute insects readily enough. The head is narrow, long and
  pointed; the upper parts are of a rich chestnut-brown with a bronzy gloss. The upper jaw is white;
  a black band extends along the sides of the head and body. The under parts are yellowish
  white.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. ornatus</i> is another inhabitant of the South-Eastern States; its name refers to the
  dark brown patches on the back and sides, bordered with golden yellow, upon a reddish-brown
  ground-tone, while the under parts are silvery white with fine grey spots. This frog, a little
  more than one inch in length, lives on land in dry places, preferably in corn-fields, has no
  voice, and, except during the pairing season, carefully avoids the water.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page209"><span class="smaller">{209}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Thoropa.</i>&ndash;The fingers and toes are free, the tips simply swollen and not dilated
  into discs. Closely allied to <i>Chorophilus</i>. <i>Th. miliaris</i>, of Brazil, the only
  species, has very long toes. The head is broad and flat. The upper, nearly smooth surface of the
  body is flesh-coloured, with brown marblings; the limbs are cross-barred; the under parts whitish,
  granular on the belly. The male is devoid of vocal sacs. The total length may be 2 inches. Hensel
  has published the following notes of this species, under the name of <i>Hylodes abbreviatus</i>.
  The tadpoles are quite flat, their bellies forming a kind of sucking disc, so that these
  creatures, even before the appearance of the hind-limbs, can quickly wriggle up vertical walls of
  stones, provided these are covered with a little water. In correlation with this habit, the root
  of the tail is not compressed laterally, but is as broad as it is high, and the usual vertical fin
  is restricted to its distal third. On the proximal portion of the tail the ventral fin is
  flattened and broadened out so as to form almost the continuation of the peculiar disc-like belly.
  The anal opening is not a projecting tube, but is a flattened transverse slit.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Cystignathidae.</b>&ndash;This is one of the largest families, and also one of the
  least satisfactory. Its numerous members, more than 150, exhibit such a versatility in adaptation
  to circumstances (there are aquatic, terrestrial, arboreal, and burrowing species), with a
  corresponding development or loss of anatomical characters which we should like to rely upon as
  taxonomic marks, that the numerous genera not only run into each other, but also get entangled
  with those of other families. In fact the whole family is ill defined. It can be characterised as
  follows:&ndash;The shoulder-girdle is arciferous; the sacral diapophyses are cylindrical or but
  slightly dilated; the metasternum has either a bony style or it forms a cartilaginous plate; the
  terminal phalanges, although they sometimes carry adhesive discs, are never claw-shaped.</p>

  <p>The last statement is, of course, intended to separate the Cystignathidae from the Hylidae, of
  which, however, the three genera <i>Thoropa</i>, <i>Chorophilus</i>, and <i>Acris</i> stand on
  debatable ground (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page186">186</a></span>, Hylidae), while, on
  the other hand, most of the Australian genera, notably <i>Chiroleptes</i>, have unmistakably
  dilated sacral diapophyses. The difference from the Pelobatidae can in this case be one of degree
  only.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page210"><span class="smaller">{210}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Cystignathidae may be said to represent the Ranidae in Notogaea. Some of them can be
  distinguished from the true, typical frogs solely by the arciferous type of the shoulder-girdle
  and sternum. There is in both families the same adaptive versatility, the same amplitude in the
  formation of the fingertips, the occasional slight dilatation of the sacral diapophyses, the same
  range in the configuration of the omo- and meta-sternum. In fact, young Ranidae, before the
  firmisternal character is assumed, are indistinguishable from Cystignathidae, and the latter would
  turn into Ranidae if they could be induced to consolidate their sternal apparatus.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of the Cystignathidae is suggestive of their being an old family,
  most of whose members have reached a high stage of morphological development. The overwhelming
  majority inhabit the Neotropical region, a few forms extending into tropical Central America and
  into the Antilles; the rest, some twenty species only, are confined to the Continent of Australia
  and to Tasmania.</p>

  <p>The family name is rather a misnomer. It is taken from the genus <i>Cystignathus</i>, which is,
  or rather was, characterised by the peculiarly broadened lower jaw, hollowed out by the vocal
  sacs; but this generic name had to give way to that of <i>Leptodactylus</i>, in obedience to the
  often senseless rule of priority. The family is composed of three subfamilies.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Hemiphractinae.</b>&ndash;Teeth are carried by both jaws, the vomers and the
  palatine bones; or by the palatines and parasphenoids in <i>Amphodus</i>. The vertebrae are
  opisthocoelous, devoid of ribs, and the sacral diapophyses are not dilated. The shoulder-girdle
  and sternum are strictly arciferous. The omosternum is very much reduced; the metasternum forms a
  cartilaginous plate. The tongue is slightly free behind. The tympanum is distinct. Three genera,
  with eight species, all inhabitants of South America.</p>

  <p><i>Hemiphractus.</i>&ndash;The head is large; the upper surface of all the cranial bones
  appears pitted, owing to most of the covering skin being involved in the ossification. The
  temporal fossa is bridged over or roofed in by the fronto-parietal and the squamosals, so that the
  orbit is completely encircled by bone, as in <i>Pelobates cultripes</i>. The terminal phalanges
  are simple and are not dilated into discs. The teeth of the lower jaw are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page211"><span class="smaller">{211}</span></span>very small and numerous. The tongue is round
  and very small. <i>H. scutatus</i>, the only species, living in Ecuador and Colombia, is a
  frog-like creature, with a large helmet-shaped head. Total length 2&frac12; inches.</p>

  <p><i>Ceratohyla</i> has the same kind of helmet-shaped head, and the orbit is likewise enclosed
  by bone, but the terminal phalanges are claw-shaped and carry regular adhesive discs. This genus,
  the five species of which live in Ecuador, bears undoubted resemblances to the Hylidae. In <i>C.
  proboscidea</i> the upper eyelid is produced into a little upright fold, as in
  <i>Amphignathodon</i> and some species of <i>Nototrema</i> and <i>Ceratophrys</i> among
  Cystignathidae. The snout is produced into a long, compressed, bifid appendage, and the heel
  carries a triangular flap. In <i>C. bubalus</i> the partly ossified helmet sends out a pair of
  diverging processes, formed by the squamosals, extending backwards and sideways from the concave
  and ridged interorbital spaces. The tip of the snout and the tips of the divergent horns form an
  equilateral triangle, and the whole head bears a striking resemblance to some of the fossil
  Reptiles from the Elgin Sandstone, e.g. <i>Triceratops</i>. Total length 3 inches.</p>

  <p><i>Amphodus wucheri.</i>&ndash;The only species of this genus has been found near Bahia. It has
  teeth on the palatine bones and five series of small teeth on the parasphenoid, but none on the
  vomers. The teeth of the mandible number about eleven on each side and decrease in size towards
  the symphysis. The tympanum is distinct; the heart-shaped tongue is free behind. The cranial bones
  are only slightly pitted. The skin is smooth above, chocolate-brown, spotted with yellow, and with
  a yellow band on the sides of the body beginning with the upper eyelid and ending in a broad patch
  above the vent. The under parts are yellowish white.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Cystignathinae.</b>&ndash;The upper jaw alone is provided with teeth. Vertebrae
  procoelous. The twenty-seven genera of this sub-family have been arranged in the following key,
  merely for convenient determination.</p>

  <p><i>Pseudis</i>, widely distributed over South America, consists of four species which have the
  appearance of long-legged frogs. The fingers, of which the first is opposed to the others, are
  free; the long toes are fully webbed. The tympanum is exposed.</p>

  <p><i>P. paradoxa</i> is absolutely aquatic, floating in pools, and is extremely shy. In life it
  is most beautifully coloured with bronze, bright green, and black markings above; underneath it is
  shiny yellow, with brown spots on the body and stripes on the thighs. Within a few minutes after
  death all the brilliant colours of the smooth skin of the back turn into dull uniform brown, with
  indistinct darker spots. Total length of the adult from 2 to 2&frac12; inches. The specific name refers
  to the peculiar shape and monstrous size of the larva or tadpole.</p>

  <p>One of the larvae described and figured by Parker measures 10&#x2153; inches in length, the
  head and body taking up 3&#x2153; inches. The spiracle lies on the left side and the hind legs are
  &frac12; inch long, just breaking through the skin. The vent is median. The huge tail is very thick and
  muscular, and is furnished with a high, irregularly shaped dorsal and ventral fin, the whole organ
  measuring 4 inches dorso-ventrally. Another larva, or rather tadpole, in the national collection
  is older, and although still very large, namely, 7 inches long, has fully developed hind-limbs 3
  inches long; the fore-limbs are less than half that size, the left protrudes through the spiracle,
  while the right has broken through the skin. The dorsal and ventral fins of the tail have much
  shrunk; the whole organ, 5 inches long, is gradually tapering to a point like the tail of ordinary
  tadpoles. By the time that the <span class="pagenum" id="page214"><span
  class="smaller">{214}</span></span>tadpole is nearly ready to leave the water, its whole bulk is
  reduced to less than one-fifth that of the largest tadpole. It measures from snout to vent only 1&frac12;
  inch (in the 7-inch tadpole this distance is fully 2 inches), and the tail, devoid of fins, is
  reduced to 2 inches in length. Instead of the solitary left spiracle there are now two, one on the
  ventral side and a little in front of the base of each arm, the border of each hole being
  continued by a peculiar semilunar fold.</p>

  <p><i>Hylodes.</i>&ndash;The numerous species, nearly fifty, of this tropical American genus
  exhibit several anatomical differences.  The tympanum is sometimes indistinct or hidden, in which
  case the Eustachian tubes are generally very narrow. The fingers are free, and carry discs, like
  the toes, which are sometimes slightly webbed. The males have a subgular vocal sac, producing a
  loud, or whistling, voice. The general appearance is that of land- and tree-frogs; the size is
  small, mostly between 1 and 2 inches.</p>

  <p><i>H. martinicensis</i> is about 1&frac12; inch in length. The ground-colour is pale yellow-grey, with
  a large brown patch on the nape, which colour is continued over the back in the shape of more or
  less coherent or dissolved patches. A dark brown stripe runs along the middle of the sides. The
  limbs are barred with brown, the under parts are whitish. This species, known by the vernacular
  name of "<i>coqui</i>" inhabits many of the West Indian islands, <i>e.g.</i> Barbadoes,
  Martinique, Porto Rico, and Hayti. It has become famous, as it was the first instance known of a
  frog which undergoes its whole metamorphosis within the egg. The pairing takes place on land, in
  the months of May and June, when the female lays about twenty eggs, which are enveloped in a foamy
  mass and glued on to a broad leaf, or hidden in the axillae of Iridaceous plants. The mother seems
  to remain in the neighbourhood watching the eggs, which are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page215"><span class="smaller">{215}</span></span>large, measuring 4-5 mm. in diameter. Dr.
  Gundlach, a resident in Porto Rico, was one day, in the month of May, attracted by sounds like
  those of a young bird, and found three males and one female of this species sitting between two
  large leaves of an orange-tree. He put them all into a glass vessel and soon saw a pair in
  embrace. The female laid about twenty-five pale straw-coloured eggs. The embryo develops neither
  gills nor gill-openings, but a large well-vascularised tail, by means of which, being immersed in
  the watery fluid contained within the egg, it seems to breathe. After twenty-one days the tadpole,
  having used up all the available yolk and fluid, and most of its own tail, bursts the egg-shell
  and hops away as a little frog of 5 mm. in length, but still with a stumpy white tail, which is
  quite absorbed within the same day.</p>

  <p>This species has several times made its appearance in the tropical houses of Kew Gardens. It
  seems to have bred and vanished again.<a id="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Calyptocephalus</i> is remarkable for the dermal ossification of the cranium, which has
  assumed the greatest possible extent. It affords a curious parallelism to <i>Triprion</i> and
  other Hylidae, which are likewise Central American forms. Only two species are known; <i>C.
  gayi</i> of Chili, and <i>C. testudiniceps</i> of Panama. They are large, thoroughly aquatic
  creatures, 5 to 6 inches in length, with huge heads. The tadpoles grow to an enormous size. One
  specimen of <i>C. gayi</i> in the National Collection is more than 6 inches in length, the tail
  taking up more than half of the total: the spiracle lies on the left side, the vent on the right,
  and the hind-limbs are still half enveloped in a kind of fold of the skin.</p>

  <p><i>Ceratophrys</i> is a genus of some ten toad-like species, living in South America, from
  Guiana to Argentina. The generic name alludes to the peculiar modification of the eyelid, which in
  most species is developed into a triangular, upright, but flexible appendage. The head, in
  conformity with the huge mouth, is very large. The tympanum is rather indistinct, sometimes quite
  hidden. Several of the species have a large dorsal shield, which is produced by a thick
  ossification of the cutis, but is not fused with any of the vertebral processes. The male has a
  vocal sac. <i>C. dorsata</i> s. <i>boiei</i> of equatorial Brazil is a monster toad, reaching
  <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span class="smaller">{216}</span></span>a length of 6 inches.
  The upper eyelid is transformed into a triangular horn, whence a cutaneous ridge extends all along
  the side of the back, meeting that of the other side above the vent. There is no osseous shield on
  the back. The tympanum is hidden. Ground-colours, orange or green, with sharply marked dark brown
  or blackish patches.</p>

  <p><i>C. cornuta</i>, in Northern Brazil, lacks the dorsal shield, but has horned eyelids and a
  visible tympanum. Its coloration renders it one of the most beautiful toad-like creatures known.
  The ground-colours are green, black and brown, with an orange-yellow stripe over the head and
  back. All these colours are most pleasingly blended and arranged in marbled patches or stripes
  radiating from various centres, as, for instance, from the eyes towards the circumference of the
  mouth, the slit of which they pass, the same line of the pattern being continued upon the lower
  jaw. The whole surface makes the impression of a gay but exquisitely harmonious carpet. The under
  parts are yellow, inclining to white towards the middle.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>C. ornata</i> has a dorsal shield. The tympanum is just visible, and the eyelids form only
  low but sharp-edged projections. This is likewise a beautiful toad, living chiefly in Uruguay,
  Northern Argentina, and Paraguay, where it is universally known as the "escuerzo," one of the
  Spanish words signifying a toad. Its size rarely surpasses 4&frac12; inches. The ground-colours are
  greenish and yellow, with large dark green patches on the back, decreasing in size on the
  flanks.</p>

  <p>Each of these insular patches is surrounded by a narrow line of white and yellow dots,
  interspersed here and there with lines of rusty brown or red. The object of this elaborate
  carpet-like pattern is concealment. These toads&ndash;and this applies to all the
  species,&ndash;bury themselves half in the ground, preferably in the grass, where they are
  well-nigh invisible. If there is not enough green vegetation, they throw, with their feet, little
  lumps of earth upon their backs, the skin of which becomes at the same time more crinkled and
  assumes duller tones. There the creature lies, perfectly concealed, betrayed only by the metallic
  glittering eyes, waiting for some unfortunate creature to pass into the trap represented by the
  enormous mouth, which opens and shuts with lightning-rapidity and with an audible snap. They seem
  to live chiefly on frogs, and sometimes they turn cannibals. Two specimens were brought over to me
  from Buenos Aires by a friend, in a well-closed basket with moist soil at the bottom, but only one
  was visible on arrival. The other was inside the <span class="pagenum" id="page218"><span
  class="smaller">{218}</span></span>larger one, and could still be felt through the soft body. This
  same cannibal took large-sized frogs greedily, one or two for a meal, swallowing them whole and
  then sinking back into its lair, which it scarcely ever left, except for an occasional soaking
  bath in its water-pan, especially before shedding its skin. It lived for many months in the same
  enclosure with a pantherine toad, <i>Bufo mauritanica</i>, of equal bulk, until one morning I
  found the Moroccan half swallowed and almost lifeless in the mouth of the American, whence it was
  rescued with difficulty. It came round after a few hours, but never fully recovered, lingering on
  for weeks; the skin was changed to a lead-colour so far as it had been swallowed and partly
  dissolved by the gastric juices, and soon began to develop festering ulcers.</p>

  <p>These "horned toads" make a squeaking noise when teazed, not at all loud or strong in
  proportion to their size. Ill-tempered individuals jump at their aggressor and can inflict rather
  painful nips. They hibernate during the dry season in the ground.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidobatrachus.</i>&ndash;Large teeth in the upper jaw, and two large tooth-like
  projections in the lower jaw near the symphysis. Vomer toothless. Sacral diapophyses not dilated.
  Tongue round, and free behind. Tympanum distinct. Great development of the membrane-bones on the
  head, and a weaker ossification in the skin of the back, recalling that in <i>Ceratophrys</i>. The
  eyes are closely set together, and the nostrils take up the most elevated portion of the head.
  Pupil horizontal. The two species of this genus were discovered by Budgett<a id="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> in the Paraguayan Chaco. <i>L. asper</i> lives continually in
  muddy pools, floating with just the eyes and nostrils above the surface. If disturbed it slowly
  sinks to the bottom, leaving no ripple. It feeds largely on <i>Bufo granulosus</i>. Total length
  from about 3 inches. The skin of the upper parts is tubercular, tough, and of a dull leaden
  colour; the tips of the toes are horny. <i>L. laevis</i> is smooth and slimy, "with the organs of
  the lateral line showing clearly upon it," a feature elsewhere known to exist in <i>Xenopus</i>
  and <i>Leptobrachium</i> only.</p>

  <p><i>Leptodactylus</i> = <i>Cystignathus</i>.&ndash;Some twenty species inhabit tropical America,
  from Central Mexico to Buenos Aires. The fingers and toes are not webbed and end mostly in points;
  only a few species, e.g. <i>L. hylaeodactylus</i>, having small adhesive discs. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page219"><span class="smaller">{219}</span></span>The legs are long and the
  general appearance is very much like that of an ordinary frog.</p>

  <p>One of the commonest and prettiest Brazilian species is <i>L. ocellatus</i>, which is
  characterised by a number of longitudinal glandular folds on the back and flanks. The colour of
  the upper parts is olive-brown, that of the prominent folds is yellowish white, interspersed with
  black spots. The under parts are yellowish white, with blackish marblings on the throat. The males
  have a sharp black spur on the inner carpal edge and one on the rudiment of the thumb. Total
  length about 4 inches.</p>

  <p>According to Hensel<a id="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> the spawning takes place in
  Rio Grande do Sul after hibernation. The voice of the male is then very loud, resembling the sound
  made by a carpenter chopping a beam. They repair to ponds and produce a cup-shaped puddle, about 1
  foot in width, by raising a wall of mud, which separates the inner water from that of the pond.
  The tadpoles remain in this nursery until the spring-rains demolish it and set the young ones
  free. Drought causes the drying up of these water-pans and subsequent destruction of the
  brood.</p>

  <p><i>L. mystacinus</i> is another Brazilian species, about 2 inches in length. Its specific name
  refers to the dark brown stripe which runs from the tip of the mouth through the eye to the
  tympanum. This species is thoroughly terrestrial, and never enters the water. It digs a cavity,
  the size of an ordinary tea-cup, under stones or rotten trunks, always in the neighbourhood of
  ponds and just so high above the water that the latter can rise up to the nest in the rainy
  reason. The straw-coloured eggs are laid in this cavity, and are enveloped in a foamy, sticky
  mass, like the well-beaten white of an egg. The young tadpoles seem to live on this froth until
  the rains set them free. When, however, the rains delay and a drought kills the broods of other
  less circumspect species, these tadpoles, still provided with gills and long tails, remain in
  their moist nest or withdraw further beneath the rotten stumps, huddled together in large numbers
  until the next rainy season.</p>

  <p>Similar nursing habits have been recorded of <i>L. albilabris</i>, which inhabits Mexico, Cuba,
  and several other West Indian islands. The same applies to <i>L. typhonius</i>. Gundlach found
  eggs <span class="pagenum" id="page220"><span class="smaller">{220}</span></span>of this "Sapo" in
  Puerto Rico on the 4th of November; on the 25th the young showed the first signs of hind-limbs, on
  the 3rd of December of fore-limbs, and on the 7th of the same month they began to climb out of the
  water.</p>

  <p><i>Paludicola</i> is a semi-aquatic genus with some eighteen species, ranging from Mexico to
  Patagonia and across the Andes into Chili. Some of them have a peculiar gland on the lumbar
  region, or large, flat warts on the back, sometimes arranged in longitudinal folds. The toes are
  slightly webbed, or free, according to the more or less pronounced aquatic habits.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig45.jpg"><img style="width:18%" src="images/fig45.jpg" alt="fig45"

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 45.</span>&ndash;<i>Paludicola fuscomaculata</i>, &times; 1,
      with vocal sacs partly filled.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>P. fuscomaculata</i>, an inhabitant of Southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is a
  short-limbed frog, with spreading slender toes and a small head. There are shovel-shaped, black,
  horny tubercles on the metatarsus. The general colour is olive above, with darker markings and
  confluent white-edged spots; the limbs are cross-barred; the lumbar glands are black, with a white
  margin in front. The male has a vocal sac. Budgett<a id="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>
  gives the following account of its habits:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The peculiar cry, which is so constantly heard in the neighbourhood of shallow pools in the
  Paraguayan Chaco, and resembles that of a kitten, is produced by the alternate inflation of throat
  and abdomen. When fully inflated, the frog appears to be the size of a golf-ball, but, if
  startled, instantaneously shrinks to one-fifth of that size, so that it seems to have vanished. It
  has also the power of ventriloquising. The food consists largely of water-beetles. In the spawning
  time it was found at night floating on the surface of pools in the distended condition, and crying
  to the females in a most mournful way. On coming to the surface it fills its lungs with a few
  gasps, greatly distending the walls of the abdomen, and then drives the air into the vocal sacs,
  causing them to become distended as the body collapses, and giving rise to a kitten-like cry.</p>

  <p>The eggs are chiefly laid in January, and are found embedded <span class="pagenum"
  id="page221"><span class="smaller">{221}</span></span>in a frothy mass floating upon the surface
  of the water. The eggs measure only 1 mm. and are without pigment, and with extremely little yolk.
  The larvae become free-swimming within from eighteen to twenty-four hours after the first
  segmentation. When ready for hatching they wriggle their way through the froth to the water below,
  and hang into it from the floating froth.</p>

  <p><i>P. biligonigera</i> s. <i>notata</i>, in Brazil, lacks the lumbar gland, the place of which
  is marked by a black spot. The upper parts are olive, with darker marblings and a dark lateral
  stripe. The male has a black throat and two external vocal sacs. Hensel found the eggs, in Rio
  Grande do Sul, in September, forming a frothy mass of the size of a fist, floating between grass
  upon the water near the margin.</p>

  <p>The following three genera may serve as Australian examples, especially since we are indebted
  to Baldwin Spencer for interesting observations made on their habits in Central Australia.<a
  id="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Chiroleptes</i>, of which six species are known, is easily recognised by the first finger,
  which is opposed to the others. The sacral diapophyses are slightly dilated. The general shape is
  that of a thick-headed, rather stout land-frog or of a tree-frog. The tympanum is distinct, and
  the toes are only half webbed, or even less, except in <i>Ch. platycephalus</i>, in which the toes
  are entirely webbed and the tympanum is indistinct. This species is about 2 inches long, uniformly
  olive-green above, with a few tubercles on the otherwise smooth skin. Other species rather
  resemble the European Natterjack in coloration.</p>

  <p>Spencer's account is as follows:&ndash;"In Central Australia <i>Ch. platycephalus</i> seems to
  prefer the hard clay pans rather than sandy creeks, as the sand-beds of the latter are too loose
  for the formation of the burrow. We came across the animal first when encamped by the side of a
  very shallow clay pan, the floor of which was deeply cracked with the sun's heat. Around the edge
  were withered shrubs of <i>Chenopodium nitrariaceum</i>, and it was at the base of these that the
  black fellows looked for the burrow. In the hard-baked clay were imprints made by the frog as it
  burrowed, and about a foot underground we came across the animal, puffed out into a spherical
  shape, and just filling up a cavity, the walls of which were moist but not wet. The ground <span
  class="pagenum" id="page222"><span class="smaller">{222}</span></span>was so hard that it had to
  be chipped away. When one side of the burrow was opened, the frog remained perfectly still; its
  lower eyelid was drawn up over the eye and was very opaque, giving rise to the belief amongst the
  blacks that the animal is blind. In the sunlight, after a short time, it opened its eyes.</p>

  <p>"On squeezing the body, water was forced out of the cloaca; this was accumulated principally in
  the urinary bladder. On cutting the body open it was seen that there was a certain amount of water
  in the subcutaneous spaces, but that the greater portion, which caused the great swelling-out of
  the body, was contained in the body-cavity itself; and it was also observed that the lungs were
  considerably distended and lengthened, their apices lying right in the pelvic region. They
  contained air and not water, but their outer faces were bathed with the water in the body-cavity."
  The larvae and tadpoles probably develop with extreme rapidity, soon to aestivate as very small
  frogs.</p>

  <p><i>Heleioporus</i> has a calcified metasternal plate and slightly dilated sacral vertebrae. The
  two species have a toad-like appearance, owing to their stout bodies, short limbs and conspicuous
  parotoid glands. <i>H. albopunctatus</i> is mottled whitish red and brown above; it extends from
  Western into Central Australia. <i>H. pictus</i> is olive, with darker marblings, and is
  distinguished by a light vertebral line. It is likewise found in Central Australia, and it extends
  into Victoria and New South Wales. Spencer found it in swarms after heavy rains, the specimens
  being much swollen and distended with caterpillars and beetles. They looked as if they were simply
  gorging themselves with food preparatory to returning again to their long aestivating
  condition.</p>

  <p><i>Limnodynastes</i> is one of the commonest genera in Australia. The six species have the
  habits and appearance of stout frogs or smooth toads. <i>L. dorsalis</i> seems to range through
  the whole of Australia, from east to west, and looks like the European <i>Pelobates</i>. The skin
  is smooth, but with an elongated white gland extending from beneath the eye to the shoulder, and
  another glandular complex on the thigh. The upper parts are mottled olive-brown, often with a
  light vertebral line. The under parts are whitish, with brown spots. The male has a vocal sac. One
  of the specimens in the National Collection contained a half-grown <i>Heleioporus
  albopunctatus</i> in its stomach.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page223"><span class="smaller">{223}</span></span></div>

  <p>Concerning the pairing and the other habits of the Anura of New South Wales we have some
  valuable notes by J. J. Fletcher.<a id="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> He observes that
  Australian frogs spawn whenever they are ready, and when the very irregular conditions of moisture
  will allow it, but that they are not all ready at the same time, <i>i.e.</i> they have no fixed
  period of the year. <i>Limnodynastes</i>, <i>Hyla aurea</i>, and <i>H. coerulea</i> deposit their
  spawn in the water, in more or less irregular floating patches, which look white and frothy. The
  period extends from July to May, and is at its height in August and September; but if there is a
  spring-drought vigorous spawning may be looked for about the middle of January, when heavy showers
  are likely to occur. <i>Crinia</i> and several <i>Hyla</i>, e.g. <i>H. ewingi</i>, spawn at any
  time of the year. The eggs form small submerged bunches, enclosed in a transparent jelly, attached
  to the blades of grass or twigs of dead branches in the water.</p>

  <p><i>Pseudophryne</i>, a genus closely resembling <i>Crinia</i>, but on account of the absence of
  teeth in the lower jaw relegated to the Bufonidae, spawns during the Australian summer and autumn.
  The numerous ova of <i>P. australis</i> and <i>P. bibroni</i> are laid separately, not in the
  water, but under stones, or in the d&eacute;bris of reed- and grass-tussocks, on the edge of a pool.</p>

  <p>The larvae of <i>Pseudophryne</i> and others have often to depend upon the next following rain,
  sometimes waiting for months to be released from the eggs, wherein they have so far developed. But
  the tadpoles, once hatched, probably do not bury themselves; they either metamorphose or die.</p>

  <p>The males of <i>Mixophyes</i> and <i>Hyla</i>, grasp the females in the axillary region; those
  of <i>Limnodynastes</i>, <i>Hyperolia</i>, <i>Crinia</i>, and <i>Pseudophryne</i> throw their arms
  round the inguinal or lumbar region.</p>

  <p>For some three months during the winter, commencing about May, the frogs, like lizards and
  snakes, resort to shelter under logs and stones, beneath which they are then to be met with in a
  more or less sleepy condition. During the hot and very dry periods many bury themselves in the
  drying-up mud, which becomes very hard, and does not release them until the next rains. They croak
  during showery times of the year. There is no evidence that any Australian species live in the
  high <i>Eucalyptus</i>-trees.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page224"><span class="smaller">{224}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Hylopsis platycephalus</i>, of South America, is of importance as forming a link with the
  Dendrophryniscinae, owing to the very small size of the teeth in the upper jaw. There are no
  vomerine teeth. The fingers and toes are webbed, and furnished with discs. The very small
  omosternum and the metasternum are cartilaginous. The pupil is horizontal. Total length, about or
  under 1&frac12; inch.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Dendrophryniscinae.</b>&ndash;The two Neotropical genera of this sub-family are
  characterised by the entire absence of teeth. The toothless condition of the upper jaw is really
  the sole character which separates them from the Cystignathinae, taken as a whole. The suppression
  of the tympanum and of the Eustachian tubes in <i>Batrachophrynus</i>, and the fully webbed toes
  of <i>B. macrostomus</i> indicate complete adaptation to aquatic life. The absence of the
  omosternum in <i>Dendrophryniscus</i>, the absence of vomerine teeth, the dilated phalangeal tips,
  the entire and quite adherent tongue, are all features which likewise occur in some of the
  Cystignathinae, and therefore cannot be urged against their affinity. Lastly, the recently
  discovered South American genus <i>Hylopsis</i> is, as pointed out by Werner,<a id="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> an intermediate link, owing to the extremely small, scarcely
  visible teeth in the upper jaw.</p>

  <p><i>Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus</i> has been found in the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro. The
  head is depressed and triangular. The tongue is entire, but free behind. The tympanum is
  suppressed. The omosternum is absent; the metasternum forms a long bony style. The sacral
  diapophyses are cylindrical. The terminal phalanges are simple, but carry dilated tips. The first
  finger is rudimentary. The skin is nearly smooth, reddish brown above, whitish below; the limbs
  are cross-barred.</p>

  <p><i>Batrachophrynus</i> inhabits the mountains of Peru. The head is much depressed and small,
  with the eyes directed upwards, as is usual in essentially aquatic species. The tongue is large,
  circular, and entirely adherent. The tympanum and the Eustachian tubes are suppressed. The
  omosternum is cartilaginous, and the metasternum forms a cartilaginous plate. The sacral
  diapophyses are cylindrical. The terminal phalanges are simple, and carry no discs. The four
  fingers are short; the toes are webbed. The male has no vocal sac. <i>B. brachydactylus</i> has a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page225"><span class="smaller">{225}</span></span>smooth skin,
  olive-brown above with darker spots. <i>B. macrostomus</i>, 2 inches in length, is distinguished
  by its larger size, and by its completely webbed toes.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Engystomatidae</b> (Narrow-mouthed Toads).&ndash;<i>Firmisternia with dilated sacral
  diapophyses.</i></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Engystomatinae.</b>&ndash;<i>Without teeth in the upper jaw.</i>&ndash;Although
  there are only about 60 species known, these have been grouped into more than two dozen genera,
  many of which are represented by one or two species only. The range of this sub-family is
  peculiar, namely, Neotropical and Palaeotropical. <i>Scaphiophryne</i> and <i>Rhombophryne</i> are
  peculiar to Madagascar; <i>Calophrynus</i> occurs in the same island and in the Indian region;
  <i>Xenobatrachus</i>, <i>Sphenophryne</i>, <i>Liophryne</i>, <i>Mantophryne</i>, <i>Callulops</i>
  and <i>Xenorhina</i> live in New Guinea. <i>Breviceps</i>, <i>Cacosternum</i> and <i>Hemisus</i>
  are confined to Africa, while of <i>Phrynomantis</i> two species live in Africa, and the third in
  the Malay island of Amboina. Such freaks of distribution indicate either that many of these genera
  are not established upon very valid characters, or that their respective species are instances of
  convergent evolution, and do not form natural genetic groups.</p>

  <p>Many of the members of this sub-family live upon ants and termites, and it is a well-known
  fact, not restricted to the Anura, that this kind of fare has a peculiar, modifying influence upon
  the structure of the mouth, teeth, tongue, limbs, and various other organs. In the present case
  the tongue is not much affected; it is, with few exceptions, more or less oval, not nicked, but
  free behind; in the Indian <i>Glyphoglossus</i> and in <i>Rhombophryne</i> of Madagascar only is
  it modified into a rather long and grooved, almost double, apparatus.</p>

  <p>A very common feature is the small size of the mouth and the formation of a snout, which
  projects beyond the upper rim of the mouth and beyond the nostrils. Such a prominent and pointed
  snout is well developed in <i>Rhinoderma</i>, <i>Phryniscus</i>, <i>Calophrynus</i>,
  <i>Stereocyclops</i>, <i>Hypopachus</i> and <i>Engystoma</i>. The mouth is very narrow in
  <i>Cacopus</i>, <i>Glyphoglossus</i>, <i>Breviceps</i>, <i>Rhombophryne</i>, and <i>Hemisus</i>,
  all creatures which seem to be confirmed eaters of ants and termites. However, it must not be
  supposed that the mouth of all the genera is narrow, although this character, rather marked in
  <i>Engystoma</i>, is now embodied in the name of the family. A peculiar development of the palatal
  region <span class="pagenum" id="page226"><span class="smaller">{226}</span></span>is possibly
  correlated with this food. The palate is mostly toothless, but its skin is frequently raised into
  a transverse fold, between or behind the vomers, and into a second fold in front of the
  oesophagus; these folds are sometimes rather hard and serrated or denticulated. The palatine bones
  carry true teeth in <i>Rhombophryne</i>, and sometimes in <i>Callula</i>; in <i>Xenobatrachus</i>
  the teeth are reduced to two large pairs. The tympanum is usually hidden.</p>

  <p>The shape of the body is generally very stout. The limbs are short, notably so in
  <i>Glyphoglossus</i>, <i>Breviceps</i>, <i>Rhombophryne</i>, <i>Hemisus</i>, <i>Stereocyclops</i>
  and <i>Cacopus</i>. Others, for instance most species of <i>Microhyla</i>, <i>Phryniscus</i>,
  <i>Callula</i>, and <i>Sphenophryne</i>, are of a very slender build; and their limbs, instead of
  being short and well adapted to digging, are long and may even be provided with typical adhesive
  discs, supported by <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped phalanges, especially in the two genera
  last named, and in <i>Scaphiophryne</i> and <i>Phrynomantis</i>. However, none of the forms
  provided with discs are known to be arboreal.</p>

  <p>Exceptional diversity is shown in the shoulder-girdle and sternum. The omosternum occurs only
  in <i>Rhinoderma</i> and <i>Hemisus</i>. The metasternum is a cartilaginous plate, very large in
  <i>Cacopus</i>, distinctly small in <i>Breviceps</i>, and almost absent in <i>Hemisus</i>. The
  precoracoids and clavicles show all stages from a well-developed condition (<i>Breviceps</i>,
  <i>Rhombophryne</i>, <i>Hemisus</i>, <i>Rhinoderma</i>, <i>Phryniscus</i> and
  <i>Brachycephalus</i>) to complete absence. The circumstance that these bars are very weak in
  <i>Melanobatrachus</i>, <i>Calophrynus</i>, <i>Scaphiophryne</i> and <i>Hypopachus</i>, i.e. in
  Pal&aelig;o- and Neo-tropical genera, indicates a widespread tendency towards complete suppression, a
  feature independently aimed at both in America (<i>Engystoma</i>) and in the Old World.</p>

  <p>Until we know something about the habits of the members of this much diversified sub-family, it
  is idle to connect the various modifications with each other, and thus, by correlation, to find
  out their meaning. Those forms which possess well-developed discs on their fingers and toes are
  said not to be arboreal. What is the true meaning of the prominent snout which is not restricted
  to the digging forms? Most of the good diggers have well-developed precoracoid bars, and the
  coracoids are distinctly strengthened, but in <i>Glyphoglossus</i> and in <i>Cacopus</i> the
  precoracoids are entirely <span class="pagenum" id="page227"><span
  class="smaller">{227}</span></span>absent, and this loss is compensated for by exceptionally
  strong coracoids.</p>

  <p>On the whole, those genera are to be considered as the most primitive which have undergone the
  fewest losses. Those with a complete shoulder-girdle, with an omo- and meta-sternum and with
  simple phalanges, are necessarily the older forms. One step farther back in another direction, the
  possession of teeth on the palate, and on the upper jaw, leads to those genera which have been
  separated off as <span class="sc">Dyscophinae</span>, while teeth in the lower jaw constitute the
  <span class="sc">Genyophryninae</span>. Lastly, the firmisternal type has necessarily been evolved
  from the arciferous condition, and there the two Bufonid genera <i>Myobatrachus</i> and
  <i>Rhinophrynus</i>, the former Australian, the latter Mexican, with their narrow and scarcely
  overlapping epicoracoid cartilages, seem to form a connecting link, although their ant-eating
  habits, with concomitant modifications in structure, may be nothing but cases of convergent
  evolution.</p>

    each with two large curved teeth. Otherwise imperfectly known.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Rhinoderma.</i>&ndash;Omosternum and precoracoids present. Palate without teeth. Tympanum
  indistinct. Terminal phalanges simple, and not dilated. Tongue heart-shaped, and free behind.
  Pupil horizontal. Habitat, Chili.</p>

  <p><i>Rh. darwini</i>, the only species, was discovered by Darwin, during the voyage of the
  <i>Beagle</i>. Its total length is only 3 cm., or little more than one inch. The shape is
  grotesque, as the skin is prolonged, beyond the very small triangular mouth, into a false nose,
  <i>i.e.</i> a nose-shaped projection, while the nostrils remain at their original place. The skin
  is smooth above, granular on the under parts, and forms a triangular flap or spur-shaped appendage
  on the heel. A glandular fold extends along the sides of the body. The general colour is brown
  above, black below, with large white patches, the latter colour being sometimes predominant on the
  throat and chest. The male has a pair of internal vocal sacs, and the use of these as nurseries
  for the young has made this species famous.</p>

  <p>Espada<a id="NtA_99" href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> has given an elaborate account of this
  species, which lives on the ground in shady woods. Its voice sounds like a little bell, and before
  taking its short jumps, it erects itself vertically upon the hind-limbs. The gular sac of the male
  opens by two slits, one on each side of the tongue. Generally this sac does not extend beyond the
  middle of the chest, but during the breeding time the eggs are put into it, whereupon it becomes
  greatly distended, so much so indeed that it reaches back as far as the groins; <span
  class="pagenum" id="page229"><span class="smaller">{229}</span></span>dorsalwards around the
  flanks, almost to the vertebral diapophyses; ventrally and forwards it reaches the chin. The walls
  of the sac are of the same structure as the buccal lining, of which they are in fact
  continuations. They adhere, at intervals, to the cutis and to the pectoral and abdominal
  muscles.</p>

  <p>The effect of the distension of the sac upon neighbouring organs is twofold. First, the viscera
  are pressed back within the abdomen; this disturbance is temporary and does not apply to all
  specimens; the feeding in no way impeded. Secondly, a permanent change is produced in the
  direction of the precoracoid bars, in such a way that each bar is curved tailwards and rests with
  its ventral half upon the coracoid; owing to this forcible bending the clavicles do not meet each
  other. There is, of course, not so much space gained by this slight rearrangement of the
  shoulder-girdle as Espada implies, but we have here, perhaps, an illustration of direct
  correlation between two originally independent organs, namely, shoulder-girdle and vocal sacs.
  Repeated distension of the throat-bag during every breeding season, while the whole organisation
  of the male is in a highly excitable condition, has pressed the clavicular bars back, or rather
  has staved them in, and this at first pathological and abnormal condition has at last become a
  fixed feature. It is to be regretted that we know next to nothing about the habits, especially the
  mode of breeding, of the other genera which likewise have reflected or very feeble precoracoids
  and clavicles. Their weakness or even complete absence must have a reason, or rather must have had
  a cause.</p>

  <p>The pairing and oviposition, and the manner in which the eggs are conveyed into the gular sac,
  have not yet been observed. Espada examined five males with young, the number of which varied from
  five to fifteen. In one male with eleven embryos the most developed tadpoles measured 13.5 mm.
  from the snout to the end of the tail, and they were lying within the chest of the father, the
  less advanced in the farther recesses of the bag. Three of the tadpoles had already
  completely-formed fore- and hind-limbs, while the arms were still hidden. The least developed were
  still globular, a proof that the eggs are conveyed into the bag. Another male with fifteen embryos
  looked as if it had gorged itself with the almost fully-formed tadpoles, which measured 14 mm.
  They were quite irregularly distributed, and nowhere <span class="pagenum" id="page230"><span
  class="smaller">{230}</span></span>attached to the walls of the bag. None of them had horny
  jaw-armaments, and not even the smallest specimens showed any traces of gills, resembling in this
  latter character those in the female brood-pouch of <i>Nototrema</i>. The intestine of the
  tadpoles is short and thick, coiled up spirally and filled with yolk, certainly not with vegetable
  or other foreign matter. Consequently the entire development from the egg to the complete
  stump-tailed little creature is undergone within the pouch; and this, after the young have
  escaped, probably shrinks back to its original size and acts as a gular vocal sac.</p>

  <p><i>Phryniscus.</i>&ndash;About ten species of this tropical American genus are known; they
  extend from Costa Rica to Buenos Aires. They differ not inconsiderably in various details. The
  tongue is elliptical, entire, and free behind. The palate is smooth. The tympanic disc is absent.
  Fingers and toes more or less webbed, sometimes with swollen tips, without, however, forming
  adhesive discs. In a few species the first toe is quite indistinct. The male has a subgular vocal
  sac. The mouth is small, and there is a short snout. The general appearance varies much. <i>Ph.
  nigricans</i> of Uruguay, etc., is stout and has very short hind-limbs; the skin of the upper
  parts is black, spotted with white, and covered with warts. Most of the other species are slender,
  with larger hind-limbs and a perfectly smooth skin, the coloration of which ranges from dull
  uniform brown, or black with crimson markings, to bright green with purple spots. The under parts
  are, as a rule, conspicuously coloured, a rare feature in Anura, the favourite colours being
  orange, yellow, or even crimson, with or without black patches.</p>

  <p><i>Phryniscus nigricans</i> has been observed in Paraguay by Budgett,<a id="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> who gives the following account. This is a brilliantly
  coloured frog of toad-like appearance, and about 33 mm. in length. The ground-colour is black,
  with yellow spots or patches on the upper parts, the under parts are black, with scarlet blotches,
  the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are scarlet. At the breeding season both sexes utter
  a call-note which consists of two clear musical "rings," followed by a long descending "trill,"
  like that of our British Greenfinch. This frog, which at ordinary times is the slowest and boldest
  of frogs, is now active and excessively shy. Swimming rapidly between the blades of grass, it
  climbs a <span class="pagenum" id="page231"><span class="smaller">{231}</span></span>tuft, and
  dilating its throat, repeats its call; but if in the least disturbed, it is suddenly gone. The
  eggs are laid in quite temporary pools in grassy ground, and form separate globules of jelly,
  which float on the surface of the water, and are heavily pigmented. The development is excessively
  rapid. The segmentation beginning at 10 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span>, they were hatched and
  wriggling about by 7 <span class="smaller">A.M.</span> the following day. They are probably washed
  down into deeper pools by the retreating waters, and for this purpose the manner in which the eggs
  are laid, namely, in separate globules of jelly, seems especially suited.</p>

  <p><i>Brachycephalus ephippium</i> in Brazil, the only species, is remarkable for the development
  of a broad dorsal shield of bone, which is fused with the processes of the second to seventh
  vertebrae, an ossification which strongly resembles that of several species of the likewise
  Brazilian <i>Ceratophrys</i>, a genus of the Cystignathinae.</p>

  <p><i>Stereocyclops</i> is remarkable for the peculiar formation and protection of the eyeballs.
  The anterior portion of the sclerotic is ossified into a ring, which surrounds the transparent
  cornea. Another peculiarity lies in the metasternum, which is so much broadened out that its
  cartilage is in wide contact with the posterior edge of the coracoids. The epidermis is everywhere
  "thickened by a chitin-like deposit." The only species, <i>S. incrassatus</i>, found near Rio
  Janeiro, is an altogether aberrant creature. Its general appearance recalls that of <i>Pipa</i>.
  The gape is large, with a slightly projecting muzzle; the limbs are so short that the upper arms
  and the thighs scarcely stand out from the broadened and flattened body, which is leathery brown,
  with a narrow white median line extending dorsally from the nose to the vent.</p>

  <p><i>Engystoma</i>, with about five species in the Southern States, Central and South America, is
  the type-genus of the whole family, chiefly on account of priority of name. It is fairly
  characteristic in so far as the mouth forms a narrow, somewhat projecting snout; the precoracoids,
  the clavicles, and the omosternum are absent, the palate is devoid of teeth, the lining of the
  mouth forms a dermal ridge across the palate and another in front of the oesophagus, the tympanum
  is hidden, the sacral diapophyses are moderately dilated, and the tongue is elliptical and free
  behind. The pupil is vertical. The fingers and toes are free, ending in slightly dilated or blunt
  tips; the terminal phalanges are simple <span class="pagenum" id="page232"><span
  class="smaller">{232}</span></span>and the hind-limbs are short. The male has a subgular vocal
  sac.</p>

  <p>The most northern species is <i>E. carolinense</i>, living in the Southern United States,
  concealed under the bark of fallen trees or in old fences. The skin is smooth, but forms a fold
  across the head, behind the eyes. The general colour is brown, with light, whitish dots on the
  under parts. Total length 1 inch.</p>

  <p><i>Breviceps</i> is a South African genus with three species. The coracoids are very strong and
  directed backwards, but so broadened that they form a long and strong symphysis, touching in front
  that of the precoracoids, which stand transversely and are well developed. The metasternum is
  cartilaginous and decidedly small. The sacral vertebra has much dilated diapophyses and is
  co-ossified with the coccyx. The general appearance is extremely stout and short, the head being
  almost drawn into the nearly globular body, and ending in a short snout with a small
  mouth-opening. The tongue is long and oval, not nicked, but slightly free behind. <i>B.
  mossambicus</i> is about 2 inches long, and looks like an overstuffed round bag, out of which the
  short arms and legs project from the elbows and knee-joints only. The tarsus is provided with a
  strong horny, spade-like tubercle, which enables the creature to dig into the ground, and into the
  nests of termites, which seem to be its chief food. Peters found this species in enormous numbers,
  during the tropical rains, coming out of the ground, whither they withdraw again completely for
  the dry season. The skin is smooth, reddish brown above, with darker patches; the under parts are
  dull white, with a large black patch on the throat.</p>

  <p><i>Hemisus</i> is another African genus, with two species, <i>H. guttatum</i> in Natal, and
  <i>H. sudanense</i> in East and West Africa. This genus is so exceptional in its shoulder-girdle,
  that Cope separated it from all the other Anura as a special sub-order Gastrechmia. The
  precoracoids are extremely strong, and form a broad symphysis from which springs the long
  cartilaginous omosternum; the coracoids are slender, very long, and converge backwards to a narrow
  symphysis, and there is no metasternum. The two symphyses are connected by a narrow cartilaginous
  median bar, probably produced by the much modified epicoracoid cartilages. However, except for the
  reverse development shown by the omo- and meta-sternum, it is easy to connect this apparently
  quite anomalous shoulder-girdle of <i>Hemisus</i> with that of <i>Breviceps</i>. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page233"><span class="smaller">{233}</span></span>(cf. Fig. 5, <span
  class="smaller">5</span> and <span class="smaller">6</span>, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page25">25</a></span>). The sacral diapophyses are slightly dilated; the fingers and toes
  are free and end in points. The tongue is triangular, broader in front. The lining of the mouth
  forms a transverse ridge across the palate, and another in front of the oesophagus. The male has a
  subgular sac. The general shape is stout, the head small and ending in a pointed snout. Colour
  brown above, with whitish spots. Total length about 2 inches.</p>

  <p><i>Glyphoglossus</i> has a peculiar tongue. It is elongated, notched behind and in front,
  divided into two lateral halves by a deep groove; moreover, the tongue is not only extensively
  free behind, but also slightly so in front. The skin of the palate forms a transverse serrated
  ridge. The precoracoids and the omosternum are absent; the metasternum is a well-developed
  cartilaginous plate. The sacral diapophyses are moderately dilated; the terminal phalanges are
  simple. <i>G. molossus</i>, the only species, is olive-brown above, marbled on the sides; the
  under parts are uniformly whitish. This creature, about 2 inches in length, looks like a roundish
  bag, with a ridiculous, short face. The type-specimen, still the only one known, was taken by Dr
  Theobald under the following circumstances:&ndash;"I had halted one day within the tidal portion
  of the Irawaddy delta, to enable my boatmen to prepare their dinner. One of my servants, having
  cooked his rice, poured out the hot water as usual on the ground, and some of it went down a hole
  that happened to be near the spot. No sooner, however, had the hot water disappeared than out
  scrambled in great haste a fine <i>Glyphoglossus</i>, only, alas! to be transferred to a
  collecting jar."</p>

  <p><i>Phrynella.</i>&ndash;The tongue is heart-shaped, free behind. The palate is smooth and
  toothless. The fingers and toes end in small discs, supported by <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped phalanges; the fingers are free, the toes extensively webbed. Precoracoids
  absent; metasternum cartilaginous. Pupil horizontal. Malay Peninsula.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. pollicaris</i> is dark olive brown above; an oblique yellow line runs from the eye to
  the angle of the mouth; a pale yellow mark, across the forehead, through the eyes, and down the
  sides of the body. A dark-centred yellow patch on the anal region. The limbs are banded yellow and
  brown. The under parts are brown, with paler specks, dark on the throat. Iris red brown. The whole
  coloration changes considerably.</p>

  <p>"They inhabit the hills of Perak from 3000 feet upwards, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page234"><span class="smaller">{234}</span></span>and live in holes in trees, which are so
  situated as to contain more or less rain-water. They have a loud flute-like, musical note, which
  they utter at irregular intervals, principally during the night. The form and size of the hole in
  which they are seem to have a great deal to do with the loudness of the note, as specimens when
  extracted from their holes have far more feeble vocal powers than they had when in them. These
  frogs blow themselves out with air, and look more like bladders than anything else. When inflated
  they float on the surface of the water, and will remain motionless for a long time, with legs and
  arms stretched out."<a id="NtA_101" href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Callula.</i>&ndash;The tongue is round, entire, and free behind. The palatine bones form an
  acute, sometimes toothed ridge across the palate; two dermal serrated ridges in front of the
  oesophagus. Fingers free, sometimes with dilated tips, supported by <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped phalanges. Precoracoids and omosternum absent; metasternum cartilaginous.
  Pupil round. About seven species in the Indian region.</p>

  <p><i>C. pulchra.</i>&ndash;The following account has been extracted from Mr. S. S. Flower's
  observations:<a id="NtA_102" href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>&ndash;</p>

  <p>This pretty creature inhabits most of the warm portions of the continental Indian region, from
  India and Ceylon to South China and Malacca. The back is a rich dark brown, divided from the
  yellow of the head by a narrow black line which extends from eye to eye and forwards to each
  nostril. A conspicuous yellow band runs from the eyes to the hind-limbs. The sides of the body and
  the limbs are mottled yellow and brown. The under parts are dirty buff; the throat of the male is
  black. The intensity of colouring varies individually and from time to time, the contrast between
  the brown and yellow being occasionally very brilliant. Total length up to 3 inches, the male
  being the smaller sex.</p>

  <p>"I have been told by both English and natives that this frog was unknown in Singapore until
  some nine or ten years ago, when it was introduced by a half-caste (why, it is not known), and
  that it rapidly spread about the island. It is now well known as the 'Bullfrog' by the English in
  Singapore, and detested for the noise it makes at night. The voice of these rotund animals can be
  heard every night after heavy rain; it is <span class="pagenum" id="page235"><span
  class="smaller">{235}</span></span>a deep guttural croak, 'wau-auhhhh,' very strident and
  prolonged. The males croak while floating on the surface of the water, the single vocal sac under
  the mouth inflated like a globe, and the arms and legs extended. They can hop well on land and are
  good swimmers. The skin is excessively slimy; the secretion comes off profusely, and dries on the
  hand into a sort of white gum, with a faint aromatic smell. This gum dissolves in hot water and
  coagulates in cold. The general appearance of these frogs is very stout, their girth being about
  twice the length from snout to vent. The tongue, which is oblong in spirit specimens, in life is
  very elastic, assuming, when extended, a vermiform shape and reaching about 4 cm. in length. They
  appear after sunset, crawling on old wood and feeding on white ants."</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Dyscophinae.</b>&ndash;<i>With teeth in the upper jaw.</i></p>

  <p>This small group of nine genera, with scarcely more than one dozen species, all with one
  exception living in Madagascar, has been separated by Boulenger from the Engystomatinae merely on
  account of the presence of teeth on the upper jaw and on the vomerine margin of the palatine
  bones. He himself remarks that <i>Calluella</i> may be considered a toothed <i>Hypopachus</i>, and
  <i>Plethodontohyla</i> a toothed <i>Callula</i>. These are obvious cases of convergent analogy.
  Except for the teeth, the Indian <i>Calluella</i> would be merged into the American
  <i>Hypopachus</i>, and this would present an instance of the most puzzling geographical
  distribution. In the case of the other two genera, one Indian and Malayan, the other Malagasy, no
  such suspicion would arise, since there are many other instances of such a coincidence of
  distribution. There is the same divergence or unsettled condition in the modification of various
  parts in the Dyscophinae as in the Engystomatinae. The precoracoid bars are weak and curved
  backwards, and closely pressed against the strong coracoids, in <i>Dyscophus</i>, <i>Calluella</i>
  and <i>Platypelis</i>, while these elements are reduced to unossified bars, and the clavicular
  portions completely lost, in <i>Plethodontohyla</i> and in <i>Phrynocara</i>. The omosternum is
  absent and the metasternum is small in all except <i>Dyscophus</i>, in which both these parts are
  exceptionally well developed and large, although remaining unossified. The palate of
  <i>Dyscophus</i> and <i>Calluella</i> is provided with curious, serrated dermal folds like those
  which are so common in the Engystomatinae; and well-developed discs on the fingers and toes,
  supported by <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped phalanges, are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page236"><span class="smaller">{236}</span></span>possessed by <i>Platypelis</i>,
  <i>Cophyla</i> and others. The sacral diapophyses are dilated. The pupil is either horizontal or
  vertical. Those which are provided with discs to the fingers and toes are climbers, and mostly
  slender and long-legged, sometimes of very small size, for instance <i>Cophyla</i>, the body of
  which is scarcely one inch in length.</p>

  <p><i>Dyscophus antongili.</i>&ndash;Madagascar. General appearance stout, with short legs and a
  wide mouth. Total length about 3 inches. The skin is mostly smooth, and forms a broad glandular
  fold which extends from the eye to the groin. The upper parts are beautiful magenta red, with a
  purplish streak beneath the lateral folds; the under parts are yellowish white, with minute grey
  specks. Red or pink colours, and the lateral folds, occur also in most of the other members of
  this family, for instance in the Indian genus <i>Calluella</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Genyophryninae.</b>&ndash;<i>With very small teeth on the anterior portion of
  the lower jaw.</i></p>

  <p><i>Genyophryne thomsoni.</i>&ndash;Pupil horizontal.  Tongue oblong and entire. With teeth on
  the palatine bones, and a serrated transverse dermal ridge in front of the oesophagus. Sternum
  cartilaginous. Precoracoids absent. Sacral diapophyses moderately <span class="pagenum"
  id="page237"><span class="smaller">{237}</span></span>dilated. Tympanum hidden. Head large and
  much depressed. Heel with a triangular dermal flap. The smooth skin is pink brown above, with
  blackish marks; a light line extends on each side from the eye along the back. Under parts black.
  About 32 mm. in length. Sudest Island, between New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Ranidae.</b>&ndash;Frogs, in the true sense, are all well diagnosed as
  <i>Firmisternia, with cylindrical sacral diapophyses</i>. According to the presence or absence of
  teeth in the jaws they can be subdivided as follows:&ndash;</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Ceratobatrachinae</b>, with teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws. The sole
  representative is the genus <i>Ceratobatrachus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Raninae</b>, with teeth in the upper, but none in the lower jaw. These are the
  Ranidae of Boulenger in the Catalogue of Batrachia Salientia.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Dendrobatinae</b>, without teeth in the upper and lower jaws.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Ceratobatrachinae.</b>&ndash;Teeth present in both jaws. Those of the lower jaw,
  between 20 and 30 in number in <i>Ceratobatrachus</i>, the only genus, are nearly all inserted
  upon the articular bone; only 2 or 3 are carried by the dentary element, which, although large,
  enters into the formation of the upper border of the jaw at the anterior end only. In the small
  extent of the share of the dentary in the formation of the edge of the lower jaw, and in its
  anterior "toothlike" process, <i>Rana adspersa</i> of Africa bears unmistakable resemblance to
  this genus. The tongue is deeply notched, and free behind. Pupil horizontal. Vomers furnished with
  teeth. Tympanum distinct and large. Precoracoids present. Omosternum and presternum with a bony
  style. Sacral diapophyses cylindrical. Fingers and toes free, with swollen tips. Outer metatarsals
  united. Male with two internal vocal sacs.</p>

  <p><i>G. guentheri</i>, Solomon Islands, the only species, has an enormous mouth and a triangular
  head not much smaller than the rest of the body. The skull is furnished with prominent ridges and
  a small curved spine at the angle of the jaws. The hind-limbs are rather short. The skin of the
  upper parts shows linear ridges, variously arranged; that of the belly is granular. A triangular
  dermal flap on the tip of the muzzle, one on the <span class="pagenum" id="page238"><span
  class="smaller">{238}</span></span>upper edge of the eyelids, others on the heel and above the
  vent. The colour and markings are very variable, the ground-colour is yellowish to pink, brown,
  grey or olive, with darker and lighter markings. Total length of the males 3 inches, of females 3&frac12;
  inches.&ndash;Guppy, the discoverer of this peculiar creature, remarks that "horned Frogs are very
  numerous in these islands, and so closely do they imitate their surroundings in colour and
  pattern, that on one occasion I captured one by accidentally placing my hand on it when clasping a
  tree."</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Raninae.</b>&ndash;The vertebrae are procoelous and devoid of ribs. The
  precoracoids are always present and ossified from the clavicles, and are parallel with the much
  stronger and ossified coracoids. The omosternum usually possesses a bony style, but in the Indian
  genera <i>Nannobatrachus</i> and <i>Nannophrys</i> and in <i>Phyllodromus</i> of Ecuador it
  remains cartilaginous, and in <i>Colosthetus</i> of Colombia it is absent. The metasternum also
  possesses a bony style, but it remains cartilaginous in the Indian genera <i>Oxyglossus</i>,
  <i>Nannophrys</i>, <i>Nannobatrachus</i> and <i>Phyllodromus</i>, in the last two genera rather
  reduced and slender, while in the Ecuadorian and Colombian genera <i>Hylixalus</i>,
  <i>Prostherapis</i> and <i>Colosthetus</i>, it is reduced to a membranous piece. In quite a number
  of genera the normal number of phalanges is increased by one owing to the intercalation of an
  extra phalanx between the terminal and the otherwise penultimate phalanx.<a id="NtA_104"
  href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> This is the case in all the species of <i>Cassina</i>,
  <i>Hylambates</i>, <i>Rappia</i>, <i>Megalixalus</i>, <i>Rhacophorus</i>, <i>Chiromantis</i>,
  <i>Ixalus</i> and <i>Nyctixalus</i>, but it is doubtful if all these genera are thereby more
  nearly related to each other than to the rest of the Raninae. The structure of the tips of the
  fingers and toes exhibits more variety. The terminal phalanges are mostly simple, with slight
  swellings at the ends, or they are <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>- or <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped in conformity with more or less developed adhesive discs; in the African
  genus <i>Hylambates</i> only they are claw-shaped, as in the Hylidae.</p>

  <p><i>Gampsosteonyx batesi</i>, recently described by Boulenger from the Gaboon, shows a unique
  modification of the terminal phalanges of the second to the fifth toes. They are transformed into
  sharp and curved claws, like those of a cat, but instead <span class="pagenum" id="page239"><span
  class="smaller">{239}</span></span>of horny sheaths, it is the bone itself which is thus sharpened
  and perforates the skin, an anomaly reminding us of the ribs of <i>Triton waltli</i>. Total length
  of the type-specimens, about 3 inches.</p>

  <p>Adhesive discs are common, and are best developed in <i>Rhacophorus</i>, <i>Ixalus</i>,
  <i>Rappia</i>, and <i>Megalixalus</i>. In the Neotropical genera, excepting <i>Colosthetus</i>,
  the discs are very peculiar, being provided on the upper side with leathery scales which are
  separated by a fissure. The fourth and fifth metatarsals either diverge and are connected by a
  distinct web, or they lie close together with only a groove between them, or lastly they appear
  externally united.</p>

      Ranidae.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The tympanic disc is very variable, large, small or quite hidden. Vomerine teeth are present or
  absent. The pupil contracts into a horizontal slit except in some Palaeotropical genera. The
  tongue is universally free behind, mostly deeply notched, and can be well protruded; only in the
  Indian <i>Oxyglossus</i> and in the Neotropical genera, excepting <i>Hylixalus</i>, its posterior
  margin is entire.&ndash;There are terrestrial, arboreal, and aquatic members in this large
  sub-family. The geographical distribution of the Raninae, which comprise about twenty genera with
  at least some 270 species, is almost entirely Arctogaean. None, with the exception of three
  species in the Papuan subregion, occur in the Australian region; and only four genera, with one or
  two species each, inhabit the tropical Andesian district, the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page240"><span class="smaller">{240}</span></span>remainder of South America being without any
  Raninae. All the species of the whole Periarctic region belong to the genus <i>Rana</i> except in
  Eastern Asia, where the closely allied genus <i>Rhacophorus</i> occurs also. The entire sub-family
  of Raninae is, in its fulness and diversity of development, essentially Palaeotropical.</p>

  <p>Many of the genera, even in the present more liberal sense as interpreted by Boulenger, are
  based upon unimportant characters, and in reality run into each other. This is for instance the
  case with <i>Rana</i> and <i>Rhacophorus</i>.</p>

  <p>The following tabular arrangement is merely a key for determination and does not necessarily
  express relationships. The presence or absence of vomerine teeth is a character easily
  ascertained, but it separates closely allied genera, for instance, <i>Rhacophorus</i> from
  <i>Ixalus</i> and <i>Micrixalus</i> from Rana.</p>

  <p><i>Phyllobates.</i><a id="NtA_105" href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>&ndash;This is one of the
  few Neotropical genera, and like nearly all of these has peculiar adhesive discs on the fingers
  and toes, each disc bearing on its upper surface two dermal scales. The tympanum is distinct.
  Vomerine teeth are absent. The general appearance of the five species is that of tree-frogs. One
  species, <i>Ph. bicolor</i>, yellowish above, dark brown beneath, lives in Cuba. The others
  inhabit Central America and Venezuela. They seem to have peculiar nursing habits. <i>Ph.
  trinitatis</i> of Venezuela and Trinidad carries its tadpoles on its back, on to which the young
  fix themselves by means of their suckers. Nothing is known about their breeding habits, for
  instance whether the young are hatched on the back, or, as seems more likely, if the parents (the
  specimen described by Boulenger<a id="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> is a male) only
  give their offspring a temporary lift in order to convey them from a drying-up pool to a healthier
  place. It is remarkable that several species of Dendrobatinae, which inhabit the same countries,
  have precisely the same habits.<a id="NtA_107" href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Arthroleptis.</i>&ndash;Slender and long-limbed little frogs, about one inch in length. The
  fingers and toes are free, very slender, and end in slightly dilated tips, the supporting
  phalanges being simple. The tympanum is variable. The skin is smooth or finely granulated. The
  colours are inconspicuous, brown or grey tones usually prevailing. About ten species are known,
  mostly <span class="pagenum" id="page243"><span class="smaller">{243}</span></span>from
  Continental Africa, a few from Madagascar and the islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p><i>A. seychellensis.</i>&ndash;Brauer<a id="NtA_108" href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> has
  discovered the mode of nursing of this frog. He found a specimen of <i>A. seychellensis</i> which
  carried nine tadpoles on its back, in the month of August, in the Seychelles, about 1500 feet
  above sea-level, upon an old tree-fern. The little ones were already provided with long tails, the
  hind-limbs were partly free, the fore-limbs still covered by the skin, and they held on by their
  bellies; not, like the young of <i>Phyllobates</i>, by their "suckers." Another specimen carried
  young which were still further developed. He also found an old frog, near which was lying a little
  heap of eggs, not enveloped in a common mass of jelly. The old frog escaped, but the eggs were
  taken care of in a vessel with moist sand at the bottom. By the following morning the eggs were
  hatched and the tadpoles were clinging by their bellies on to the walls of the glass. Brauer
  concludes that the young, when hatched, creep on to the parent's back, he or she waiting near the
  heap of eggs until the latter are ready. Curiously enough, he did not find out the sex of the
  nurse, nor are we told if the young are taken to the nearest water to finish their metamorphosis,
  or if they remain upon the parent's back until they hop off as baby-frogs. The yolk is very large.
  When the four limbs are already developed, the gill-cavity possesses no gills and no outer
  opening; and since the lungs are only just beginning to sprout, the tadpole must needs breathe by
  means of its skin. The jaws have no horny coverings. The adults live on the ground between moist
  leaves, and eat chiefly termites.</p>

  <p><i>Cornufer</i>, with about twelve species, is an essentially Austro-Malayan and Polynesian
  genus, but one species, <i>C. johnstoni</i>, has been found in the Cameroons. The fingers and toes
  are free, and their <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped phalanges support adhesive discs. The
  tympanum is distinct. The general shape is frog-like, usually with slender and very long
  hind-limbs and toes, the discs of the latter being much smaller than those of the fingers. The
  coloration is dull, mostly brown, more or less marbled, whitish below. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page244"><span class="smaller">{244}</span></span>upper eyelid of some species, <i>e.g.</i> of
  <i>G. unicolor</i> of New Guinea, has a small tubercle, hence the generic name. The skin of the
  back is glandular and granular, forming slight folds on the back and on the sides of the head in
  some species. The male has one or two internal vocal sacs.</p>

  <p><i>C. corrugatus</i> is one of the most widely distributed species, inhabiting the Philippines,
  New Guinea, and Duke of York Island. The granular skin forms longitudinal folds on the back, one
  of which reaches from the eye to the shoulder. Brownish above with darker markings, below
  yellowish, with or without brown spots on the throat.&ndash;Three species inhabit the Fiji
  Islands.</p>

  <p>Of <i>C. solomonis</i> of the Solomon Islands little is known about the propagation, although
  the large size of the egg, which measures 5 mm. in diameter, suggests that the young undergo most
  or the whole of their metamorphosis within the egg.</p>

  <p><i>Chiromantis</i> is distinguished by the peculiar arrangement of the fingers, the first and
  second being opposed to the others; their terminal phalanges are obtuse and support small knobs or
  discs. The general shape is that of a frog with long and slender hind-limbs. The tympanum is
  distinct.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. xerampelina</i>, the type-species, was discovered by Peters at Mozambique; it is a
  middle-sized frog, about 2 inches in length, brown above with reddish spots on the sides; the male
  is devoid of vocal sacs.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. petersi</i>, a native of East Africa, differs from the preceding by the possession of an
  internal vocal sac. <i>Ch. rufescens</i> = <i>guineensis</i> shows very little of the typical
  grasping arrangement of the fingers; the two inner ones are separated from the two outer fingers
  by a wide gap, but they all lie in the same plane, are much webbed and possess large discs, so
  that by the latter two characters a link is formed with <i>Rhacophorus</i>, to which the present
  genus is closely allied. Total length about 2&frac12; inches.</p>

  <p>Buchholz<a id="NtA_109" href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> has observed the peculiar breeding
  habits of this rather large, brown, and slender tree-frog in the Cameroons. In the month of June
  he found on the leaves of a low tree, standing in the water, a white foamy mass, like the froth of
  a broken egg, containing a number of newly hatched larvae and quite transparent eggs. Within three
  or four days this mass became <span class="pagenum" id="page245"><span
  class="smaller">{245}</span></span>fluid, and the larvae, provided with external gills and a long
  tail, swam about in the slime. In the natural course of events the larvae are probably washed down
  into the water by the rain. He found that the female deposits the eggs in the foamy mass at night,
  during the months of June and July, on various kinds of trees, either between the roots or in a
  cavity formed by gluing together several leaves, sometimes 10 feet and more above the water, or
  near the margin. On one occasion the mother was seen sitting upon the foamy mass, clasping the
  same with its four limbs.</p>

  <p><i>Rhacophorus.</i>&ndash;This large genus, containing more than forty species, has a curious
  distribution. At least one dozen species are found in Madagascar, eight or nine in Ceylon, the
  rest in Southern India, the Himalayas, the Malay Islands and Philippines, extending northwards
  through China and Southern Japan. Therefore this genus, with the three species of the African
  <i>Chiromantis</i>, extends over the whole of the Palaeotropical region. The generic name has
  reference to the possession by many species of little dermal flaps, especially at the inner side
  of the heel, and it has nothing to do with the parachute-like use of the hands and feet of certain
  species, to be mentioned presently.</p>

  <p>The terminal phalanges are generally bifurcated, rarely obtuse, and support well-developed
  adhesive discs. The fingers and toes are webbed to a variable extent. The two outer metatarsals
  are likewise connected by a web. The tympanum is distinct. The general appearance is that of
  tree-frogs, and many of them are green. The males have one or two internal vocal sacs. Not all the
  species have dermal appendages. <i>Rh. maximus</i>, for instance, the largest of all, living in
  the Himalayan forests, has none. A heel-flap occurs in some half-dozen Indian species; and <i>Rh.
  madagascariensis</i> has these flaps on the heels and on the elbows. Some have queer little
  lappets above the vent, or on the edges of the arms and legs; in others the bend of the arm is
  fringed. The small size of these appendages, in comparison with the webs and discs, makes them
  practically useless so far as increase of surface is concerned, and they have most likely some
  other, although unknown meaning, especially the flaps over the vent. Lastly, in the majority of
  species the fingers are not more than half-webbed, or even less, and in a few only, the webs reach
  down to the discs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page246"><span class="smaller">{246}</span></span></div>

  <p>Several species of this genus are remarkable for two reasons. First, the great enlargement of
  the fully-webbed hands and feet, which are then used as parachutes; secondly, the mode of
  propagation.</p>

  <p>Greatly exaggerated notions are, however, entertained about the parachutes, ever since
  Wallace's description<a id="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> of the first "flying
  frog." The creature was brought to him in Borneo by a Chinese workman. "He assured me that he had
  seen it come down, in a slanting direction, from a high tree, as if it flew.... The body was about
  four inches long, while the webs of each hind-foot, when fully expanded, covered a surface of four
  square inches, and the webs of all the feet together about twelve square inches."</p>

  <p>The species in question is <i>Rh. pardalis</i>, an inhabitant of Borneo and of the Philippine
  Islands. Specimens from Wallace's Collection are in the National Collection and the largest
  specimen <span class="pagenum" id="page247"><span class="smaller">{247}</span></span>shows the

  <p><i>i.e.</i> for the four limbs 18.8 square cm. = about 3 square inches, and not 78 square cm.
  or 12 square inches. By some unfortunate oversight Wallace must have mixed up the total expanded
  area with that of the four hands and feet! In Brehm's <i>Thierleben</i> the 78 square cm. have
  increased to 81 cm., and the artist has in the somewhat larger species <i>Rh. reinwardti</i>
  improved upon this, and has produced a truly startling picture by a further exaggeration based
  upon the figure given by Wallace.</p>

  <p><i>Rh. reinwardti</i> lives in the forests of the mountains of Java and Sumatra. It reaches 3
  inches in length, and is grass-green above, yellow below. Younger specimens are further adorned
  with large blue patches on the webs of the hands and feet and behind the armpits. Besides the flap
  on the heel and the curious cutaneous fringe on the forearm, suggestive of an incipient
  flying-membrane, the skin forms a projecting fringe on the inner side of the fifth toe and a
  transverse flap above the vent.</p>

  <p>Of <i>Rh. leucomystax</i>, Annandale, who accompanied the Skeat Expedition to Malacca, gives
  the following account:&ndash;"This frog, which is called by the Malays of Lower Siam either
  'Berkata Pisang' (banana-frog) or 'Berkata Rhumah' (house-frog), lays its eggs either on leaves of
  branches overhanging the water, or on the mud surrounding buffalo-wallows. The ova are enclosed in
  a round mass of yellow froth, which afterwards becomes steel-grey, about as large as a
  cricket-ball. Should they be placed judiciously in a position sheltered from the sun, the tadpoles
  may either hatch, and reach a considerable degree of development, before the mass is washed into
  the water, or the froth may be melted almost as soon as it is formed and the eggs be carried into
  a pool by a shower of rain. Very often, however, the whole mass is dried up by the heat of the sun
  before the rain comes. During the breeding season, which seems to occur as often as the land is
  flooded under the trees, for I have never seen the eggs of this frog on the bank of a river, the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page248"><span class="smaller">{248}</span></span>males croak loudly,
  producing a sound which can hardly be distinguished from the chattering of the large black and
  yellow squirrel, <i>Sciurus bicolor</i>."</p>

  <p>These arboreal frogs have a peculiar mode of nursing the young and taking care of the eggs.
  <i>Rh. maculatus</i> of Ceylon, Malacca, etc., and <i>Rh. schlegeli</i> of Japan, lay their eggs
  in a foamy mass, the size of a fist, on the margins of ponds, and the whole process has recently
  been described by Ikeda.<a id="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> He observed the
  Japanese <i>Rh. schlegeli</i> depositing the eggs in soft, muddy ground covered with grass, and in
  wet, muddy banks of paddy-fields, ponds, and similar localities near Tokyo. Sometimes they are
  deposited between the leaves of trees, near the ground. The breeding season extends from the
  middle of April to the middle of May. Towards the evening the female, bearing the much smaller
  male on her back, retires underground for the deposition of the eggs. The spots chosen are 10-15
  cm. above the surface of the water; the female digs a spherical hole 6-9 cm. wide. Sitting thus
  concealed underground, the frogs assume a dark colour and the spawning takes place during the
  night, whereupon the parents leave the nest. The eggs are enveloped in a white mass of jelly full
  of air-bubbles, the whole frothy lump looking like the well-beaten white of a hen's egg, with the
  yellowish eggs scattered through it, and measuring some 6 cm. in diameter. The air-bubbles are 2-3
  mm. large. The froth is originally very elastic and sticky, but it gradually sinks down, becomes
  liquid and ultimately runs out of the hole. It is produced in the following peculiar manner.
  During and after the deposition of the eggs the female puts her feet upon the sticky jelly, part
  of which adheres and is then pulled out as a thin, transparent membrane stretching between both
  feet. The latter are then thrust backwards, the membrane is folded downwards and becomes a vesicle
  of 5 to 10 mm. in width. By repeated working of the limbs the successively formed bubbles are
  trodden and kneaded into froth, which ultimately surrounds and at the same time separates the
  eggs.</p>

  <p>The female of <i>Rh. reticulatus</i> of Ceylon attaches the eggs, about twenty in number, to
  the under surface of her belly, on the skin of which they leave little cellular impressions. What
  becomes of the tadpoles is not known.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page249"><span class="smaller">{249}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Rh. leucomystax</i> is found in the Malay Archipelago, Farther India, and the Philippine
  Islands.</p>

  <p>S. S. Flower<a id="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> found the tadpoles about
  Singapore, from January to April, in small ponds and in rain-water butts. The spiracle lies on the
  left side, directed backwards and upwards, nearer the anus than the end of the snout. The anus
  opens on the right side. Exceptionally large tadpoles measured 46 mm. in total length, the
  recently transformed young only 14-18 mm.</p>

  <p>"A cheerful little frog of most graceful build. It comes out from its hiding-places shortly
  before sunset, and remains abroad all night. The males are easily found as they sit on shrubs or
  trees, or on the edges of the rain-water butts under the verandahs of the houses, and from time to
  time utter a single, rather musical, short croak. In March and April they can be found both by day
  and night in embrace, in the ponds. This species changes both its colour and markings very rapidly
  and frequently, but dark bands across the legs can always be more or less distinguished; the lower
  parts are some shade or other of buff, but the principal variations of the upper part are as
  follows: pale bronze, either uniform or with four longitudinal dark-brown or black lines; uniform,
  almost orange, bright bronze; chocolate, with darker mottling; pale brownish green or olive, with
  irregular dark spots; yellowish green, mottled with darker or brown." The females are considerably
  larger than the males; the largest male caught was 48 mm. from snout to vent, and the largest
  female 68 mm.</p>

  <p><i>Rana.</i>&ndash;The following combination of characters should be a sufficient diagnosis:
  pupil horizontal; tongue deeply notched and free behind; vomers with teeth; fingers free, toes
  webbed, fourth and fifth metatarsals diverging and webbed together.</p>

  <p>In conformity with the great number of species and the wide distribution of this genus some of
  the organs vary considerably, indeed so much so that many of these modifications have been deemed
  sufficient to be of generic importance. Fortunately the species are so numerous that these
  characters mostly form an uninterrupted series from one extreme to the other.</p>

  <p>The terminal phalanges are mostly simple and pointed; sometimes transversely dilated or <span
  class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped, according to the presence of more or less developed discs. Such
  discs are, for <span class="pagenum" id="page250"><span
  class="smaller">{250}</span></span>instance, present in the Malay species <i>R. erythraea</i> and
  <i>R. chalconota</i> and in the Indian <i>R. corrugata</i>. The tympanum occurs in every stage
  from a conspicuous, free disc to being quite hidden by the skin. The vomerine teeth either form a
  pair of tiny, mostly transverse rows, between the choanae, or they are arranged in two oblique
  series which extend beyond the hinder edges of the choanae.</p>

  <p>The vocal sacs vary greatly. Many species, e.g. <i>R. agilis</i>, have none at all. Most
  species have a pair of internal sacs, and in comparatively few, about a dozen, these sacs have
  become external, a feature which indicates no relationship of the species thus distinguished, for
  instance the European <i>R. esculenta</i>, the Japanese <i>R. rugosa</i>, the Indian <i>R.
  hexadactyla</i>, <i>R. cyanophlyctis</i> and <i>R. Chloronota</i>, the Bornean <i>R.
  glandulosa</i>, the African <i>R. oxyrhynchus</i> and <i>R. mascareniensis</i>, the Mexican <i>R.
  montezumae</i>. In <i>R. esculenta</i>, and perhaps in a few others, even the female has some
  traces of these otherwise male organs, indicated by slit-like folds of the outer skin below the
  angles of the lower jaw.</p>

  <p>Nuptial excrescences on the inner metacarpal tubercle and on the inner fingers of the male are
  common; they reach their greatest development in the Himalayan <i>R. liebigi</i>, the male of
  which is "remarkable for the extreme thickness of its arms, the inner sides of which are studded
  with small conical black spines, each supported on a rounded base produced by a swelling of the
  skin. A large patch of similar spines exists on each side of the breast."<a id="NtA_113"
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Specific glandular complexes in the skin are mostly restricted to a pair of lateral or
  dorso-lateral folds; they are often absent, but a few species, e.g. <i>R. glandulosa</i> of
  Borneo, <i>R. temporalis</i> of Ceylon, <i>R. elegans</i> and <i>R. albolabris</i> of West Africa,
  have a pair of large flat glands at the base or inner side of the arms.</p>

  <p>All the species of <i>Rana</i>, except those in the Solomon Islands, spawn in the water, where
  the development of the tadpoles takes its course. Those of some Indian species, notably <i>R.
  alticola</i> and <i>R. afghana</i> of the Himalayas, and <i>R. curtipes</i> of Malabar, are very
  peculiar, being provided on either side of the shoulders with a large oval parotoid-like gland,
  well defined and crowded with pores; <i>R. alticola</i> possesses in addition an unpaired, sharply
  <span class="pagenum" id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>marked glandular
  complex on the top of the root of the tail, or rather upon the future coccyx. These complexes
  gradually disappear with age.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Rana</i>, with about 140 species and subspecies, is distributed over the whole of
  Arctogaea so far as this is available for Amphibian life, while there are only a few stragglers in
  Notogaea, namely, a few species in Ecuador and in the Peruvian or Upper Amazon district. None
  exist in the rest of the Neotropical region, including the Antilles, and practically none in
  Australia; but <i>R. arfaki</i> and <i>R. papua</i> inhabit New Guinea and the northern corner of
  Australia, <i>R. kreffti</i> the Solomon Islands. A few species are restricted to Madagascar, and
  a few others live there and on the continent of Africa.</p>

  <p>So far as number of species is concerned, the home of the genus <i>Rana</i> is the
  Palaeotropical region; about one dozen (some of them with a very wide range) live in the
  Palaearctic sub-region, scarcely more in the Nearctic sub-region, and a few in Central
  America.</p>

  <p><i>R. temporaria</i> (the common European Brown Frog or Grass-frog).&ndash;The tympanum is
  distinct, two-thirds the diameter of the eye in size. The first finger is slightly longer than the
  second, which is shorter and weaker than the others, whilst the fourth is the longest. All the
  fingers are quite free. When the hind-limbs are laid forwards along the body, the ankle-joint
  reaches to a point between the eye and the tip of the snout. The five toes, which are about half
  webbed, increase in length from the first to the fourth, while the fifth is about equal to the
  third. The sole of the foot has a small, blunt, inner metatarsal tubercle; the outer one is
  scarcely visible. The skin is smooth, always moist, owing to the minute mucous glands; but a
  series of larger glands forms a pair of folds along the upper sides of the back; beginning behind
  the eyes they converge slightly beyond the shoulders, diverge a little in the sacral region, and
  converge again towards the vent. Another, much feebler, <span class="sans
  fwb">&Lambda;</span>-shaped ridge lies between the shoulders.</p>

  <p>The male has two internal vocal sacs, which, when in use, bulge out the skin of the throat
  beneath the angles of the mouth like a pair of globes. It is further distinguished from the female
  by the stronger muscles of the arms and by a pair of swollen pads on the inner side of the first
  finger. During the pairing <span class="pagenum" id="page252"><span
  class="smaller">{252}</span></span>season these pads are enlarged into cushions covered with black
  horny rugosities.</p>

  <p>The iris is golden, with dark specks. The coloration is, generally speaking, brown above, with
  black-brown irregular spots, especially on the sides of the body, and with cross-bands on the
  legs. The under parts of the male are white or pale yellow, with a bluish tinge on the throat,
  while the female is more yellow instead of white, inclining to orange. In both sexes the under
  parts are mostly spotted with darker colours. A large dark-brown patch, extending from behind the
  eye over the tympanum towards the shoulder, is always present and has given this frog its specific
  name. Otherwise the coloration varies considerably; more or less according to the locality and
  nature of the surroundings, and to individual variation and temporary change of colour.</p>

  <p>Some specimens are almost spotless above and of a rich brown, or almost yellow colour, the
  spots being restricted to the sides below the lateral folds. Others have very few spots, but these
  are then arranged in two interrupted streaks on the back. The under parts, especially the flanks,
  may be lemon yellow instead of whitish, and the darker markings may be almost absent. Boulenger
  has figured a beautiful specimen, almost orange red, with red spots and vermiculations on the
  yellow under surface. I have found similar red specimens of unusually striking appearance between
  Berlin and Spandau in a forest-glade, through which run little streams with banks of red
  ferruginous soil. Specimens which live in woods with rich black soil are often very dark, all the
  brown and reddish tints being absent. The variations are, however, really endless, and it is
  difficult to find two individuals exactly alike, even amongst a great number collected in the same
  locality. Moreover, they change colour. Warmth makes them paler, cold causes the chromatophores to
  expand and the whole frog appears darker. During the breeding season the males assume a delicate
  bluish hue, especially on the throat, but this film quickly fades away when they are taken out of
  the water. It is caused by the swelling of the cutaneous lymph-spaces which extend their
  ramifications into the epidermal layer, and it is not a question of pigmentation or of
  chromatophores, but a case of interference-colours, blue being frequently the result of the light
  passing through a cloudy, colourless, but not <span class="pagenum" id="page253"><span
  class="smaller">{253}</span></span>quite transparent and thin stratum, in this case the turgid
  epidermis.</p>

  <p>The habits of the Grass-frog are essentially terrestrial. It spends most of its time on land,
  preferably in damp places, but local fashion permits of a great deal of freedom, as these frogs
  are sometimes found not only in very wet, naturally irrigated places, but also in the water
  itself. However, the Grass-frog when pursued rarely takes to the water for safety. It trusts to
  flight, first by a few long and fast jumps, and then to concealment by squatting down between
  grass, under leaves; it rarely creeps into a hole, even if there be one near. The jumps soon
  become shorter and shorter after a few dozen repetitions. It swims well, but cannot climb. The
  food, which consists chiefly of insects, snails, and worms, must be moving to excite interest;
  then the frog, whose favourite position is half squatting, half supported by the arms, erects
  itself, and, facing the insect, turns round upon its haunches, adjusts its position anew by a
  shifting of the legs, and betrays its mental agitation by a few rapid movements of the throat. All
  this time the prey is watched intently until it moves; then there follows a jump, a flap of the
  tongue and the insect is seen no more. As a rule these frogs do not crawl, they jump or hop, even
  whilst stalking, and this takes place at any time of the day; in fact they are very diurnal,
  although they become more active towards the evening. When caught they are at first very wild and,
  like all true frogs, very impetuous, committing acts of astonishing stupidity without any apparent
  sense or appreciation of distance or height. The captive will not only jump off the table, whilst
  a toad stops at the edge and looks carefully down, but without hesitation he jumps out of the
  window, regardless of the height above the ground. This is due to sheer fright; he loses his head.
  When at large in his native surroundings, nothing will induce him, although hotly pursued, to
  commit suicide by jumping down a precipice. But all this wildness calms down wonderfully soon. The
  captive no longer dashes his head against the glass, he does not struggle or twist when taken up;
  on the contrary, he makes himself at home, watches your coming with intense expectation, and
  without hesitation accepts the proffered mealworm, maggot, butterfly or earthworm; in short, he
  shows what a jolly and intelligent fellow he really is.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page254"><span class="smaller">{254}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Grass-frog has many more obvious enemies than perhaps any other Amphibian, and it is not
  even slightly protected by any appreciable poisonous secretion. Nevertheless it is extremely
  common. A whole host of birds eat it&ndash;for instance, buzzards, harriers, and above all storks.
  Foxes, polecats, and stoats are not averse to it, and the Grass-snake derives its main sustenance
  from it. In fact the enemies of the little frog are legion, one of the worst being Man. In France,
  Italy, and other parts of the Continent, the skinned fleshy hind-limbs are turned into a by no
  means disagreeable rago&ucirc;t, or into dainty morsels when fried in butter and encrusted with
  bread-crumbs. This frog, together with its cousin the Water-frog, also suffers from the
  distinction of being one of the chief martyrs to science. Perhaps the story is true that Galvani
  was led to his investigations into animal magnetism and electricity by observing that the legs of
  a number of skinned frogs, strung up by his wife upon the bronze railings of the balcony, jumped
  whenever the scissors, which cut off the feet, touched the other metal. Frogs have suffered ever
  since. Easily procured and of a convenient size, they are used in every biological laboratory, and
  the young student is supposed to be initiated into the mysteries of Vertebrate structure by the
  careful dissection and study of this, the worst of all the so-called types. Next to Man there is
  no animal which has been studied so minutely, and has had so many primers and text-books written
  on it, as this frog. In spite of all this it is very little understood, thanks to its rather
  aberrant and far from generalised structure.</p>

  <p>However, the frog, by reason of its fertility, holds its own. Early in the year, sometimes
  while there is still ice and snow, the frogs leave their hibernating places (mostly holes in the
  ground, under moss, or in the mud), and they begin to pair in standing or slowly flowing, mostly
  shallow, waters.</p>

  <p>They are not always very careful in the selection of the spawning locality, many of them lay
  their eggs in a ditch, or even in the shallowest puddle, which is sure to dry up, and thus to
  cause the destruction of the whole brood. This carelessness is all the more surprising when there
  are large pools or lakes in the immediate vicinity, perhaps only one hundred yards to the other
  side of the road. The Natterjack is, by the way, equally careless, while other toads and the
  tree-frogs are very circumspect.</p>

      stages in the development from the egg to the almost complete Frog, &times; 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Both sexes can croak, and this sound is frequently produced under water; but there are no
  regular concerts, although many collect in the same pond or spring, which is perhaps the only
  suitable place for miles around. The male puts its arms around the chest of the female, behind her
  arms, and the embrace is so firm that nothing will induce him to loosen his hold. The process
  becomes an involuntary reflex-action, a cramp which may last for days, or even for weeks, if
  sudden cold weather sets in, until the female is ready to expel the eggs, an act which is quick
  and soon over. The usual time of spawning in Middle Europe is the month of March, earlier in warm,
  later in cold seasons; in southern countries, February or even January, but in Norway not until
  May. Although the males of this species are not more numerous than the females, and therefore
  should be able to mate without much trouble, their ardour is so great that they occasionally get
  hold not only of the wrong kind of frogs, but of toads or even fishes, and, if taken off by force,
  they fasten on to anything else, a log or on to your own fingers. The eggs measure 2-3 mm. in
  diameter, are black with a whitish spot on the lower pole, number from 1000 to 2000, and sink at
  first to the bottom. Their gelatinous cover soon swells to a large globe more than 10 cm. in
  width, and the whole mass, as large as a man's head, floats on the surface, often stained with mud
  and other impurities. During the cold weather which often prevails in the spring, the dark brown
  larvae are slow in their development; and provided with rather large branched external gills and a
  well-developed tail, they wriggle about in the dissolving slime for three or four weeks. Fischer
  Sigwart<a id="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> has timed and measured them as
  follows.&ndash;The eggs were laid on the 10th of <span class="pagenum" id="page256"><span
  class="smaller">{256}</span></span>March. On the 15th the larvae were 4 mm. long and began to
  leave the eggs. On the 19th they measured, body 4, tail 9, total 13 mm.; on the 5th of April 10,
  16, and 26 mm. respectively. On the 13th of May they were 40 mm. long and the hind-limbs appeared;
  the fore-legs burst through on the 25th, when the tadpoles had reached their greatest length,
  namely 45 mm., the body measuring 15 mm. On the 31st of May they left the water, still provided
  with a rather long tail of 20 mm., the total length being reduced to 35 mm. The larvae of this set
  developed unusually fast, perhaps owing to artificial conditions. The whole development is,
  however, mostly finished in three months, so that the little stump-tailed baby-frogs swarm about
  well before midsummer, and have time enough to grow to the size of 20 mm. or &frac34; inch before they
  begin to hibernate in October.</p>

  <p>In higher localities and in northern countries the tadpoles are sometimes obliged to winter in
  the unfinished condition.</p>

  <p>In spite of the unusually hot summer of 1899 I found plenty of tadpoles on the 10th of
  September in the tarns of the hills of North Wales, 1500 feet above the level of the sea; while
  thousands of little frogs, with and without stumpy tails, were hopping about in the surrounding
  bogs. The water of these tarns is always very cool. Cold and rainy weather set in by the middle of
  the month, and on the 26th the tadpoles, all rather small, measuring only 35 mm., with the four
  limbs developed, but still with a broad fin on the tail, had all settled down under stones at the
  bottom of the now very cold water, prepared for hibernation. A few were taken home and kept in a
  glass vessel with water, cool, but less so than that of their native tarns. Within two days they
  lost the fins on their tails; before the end of a week they left the water, and crawled on to the
  moss, and the tails were reduced to little stumps. By the 10th of October the metamorphosis was
  complete, the little frogs measured only 13 mm. in length and showed no desire to hibernate in the
  genial atmosphere of the greenhouse.</p>

  <p>This species has a very wide distribution. It ranges from the west of Ireland to the islands of
  Saghalin and Yezzo, being found everywhere in the enormous stretch of intervening countries,
  practically the whole of Central and Northern Europe and the middle belt of Asia. Its most
  northern extent is the whole of Sweden and Norway. I have found it to the east of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page257"><span class="smaller">{257}</span></span>Dovrefjeld, at an elevation
  of 4000 feet, well-nigh the snow-line. In conformity herewith it ascends the Italian Alps up to
  10,000 feet. The southern limit in Europe is the Cantabrian range and the hilly province of
  Galicia. In the rest of the peninsula, in Italy and Lombardy, Greece and Turkey, and on the
  Mediterranean islands it is absent.</p>

  <p><i>R. arvalis</i> is often confounded with <i>R. temporaria</i>, as it differs from the latter
  only by the following characters. The snout is rather more pointed and is narrower; the inner
  metatarsal tubercle is large, compressed, and hard; the dorso-lateral glandular folds are more
  prominent and the belly is white and immaculate; lastly, it scarcely reaches 3 inches in length, a
  size which is not rarely surpassed by the other species. There are also some differences in
  habits. <i>R. arvalis</i> prefers moist, boggy, open localities, and does not ascend beyond 2000
  feet in Central Europe. It pairs as a rule later in the spring and the eggs are smaller, only 1&frac12;-2
  mm. in diameter; they do not swell up so much, and the whole mass does not float but remains at
  the bottom of the shallow water. The coloration much resembles that of <i>R. temporaria</i>, and
  is likewise subject to much variation, except that the pale vertebral stripe is perhaps more
  common. This species is distributed over the whole of Central Europe, Russia, and Western Siberia,
  south of the 60th degree of latitude, living side by side with <i>R. temporaria</i>. Between the
  rivers Elbe and Rhine it becomes decidedly rare, and the latter river is practically its western
  boundary, while the Bavarian Alps and the Danube form its southern limits.</p>

  <p><i>R. agilis</i> is still more frequently confounded with both the two former species. It
  differs from either by the absence of the two internal vocal sacs of the male, and by the
  decidedly longer hind-limbs, the tibio-tarsal joint reaching often a little beyond the tip of the
  snout. The inner metatarsal tubercle is as prominent as in <i>R. arvalis</i>. Total length up to 3
  inches. The prevailing colour of the upper parts is rather yellow or pink-brown with few and small
  blackish spots; a <span class="sans fwb">&Lambda;</span>-shaped dark mark on the neck is often
  present, and the large dark patch on the temporal regions is always conspicuous. The under parts
  are white, inclining to lemon yellow on the flanks and thighs. The iris is golden yellow in its
  upper half, dark brown in the lower half.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page258"><span class="smaller">{258}</span></span></div>

  <p>This species has a much smaller range than the first two:&ndash;from France through Middle and
  Southern Germany, Switzerland, and Lombardy to Hungary and Greece. The specific name refers to the
  quick and long leaps of this pretty, or rather delicately coloured frog, which prefers woods and
  wooded glens to large open places. Their voice differs much from the croak of the common Brown
  Frog, and agrees with that of <i>R. arvalis</i>, which is transcribed by Boulenger, who has kept
  them alive, as a rapidly uttered "co-co-co," or "cor-cor-cor." According to the same authority,
  the pairing takes place as in <i>R. temporaria</i>, but is of much shorter duration, the females
  usually resorting to the water only at night and when quite ready to spawn. Specimens in embrace
  are therefore seldom found in the daytime. The eggs resemble those of <i>R. temporaria</i> in
  size, but they do not swell up so much and they do not float.</p>

  <p>These three species of European brown frogs, difficult enough to distinguish, have of late been
  increased by three more, thanks to the sagacity of Boulenger. These latter inhabit South Europe,
  and the males all lack the internal vocal sacs.</p>

  <p><i>R. iberica</i> has a very small range, namely the north-western portion of the Iberian
  peninsula, from the Tagus northwards into Galicia, but south of the main extension of the
  Cantabrian chain. The rest of the Peninsula south of these mountains has no brown frogs, the only
  species of <i>Rana</i> being <i>R. esculenta</i>. <i>R. iberica</i> is rather local, being
  restricted to those hilly and mountainous districts which are well watered. A favourite haunt is
  the numerous streams in the wooded parts of the Serra Gerez, the red, disintegrated granite of
  which suits this little, extremely active, and reddish frog to perfection. The prevailing
  ground-colour varies according to the district, from pale to dark reddish or orange brown, with
  red specks and larger, dark brown spots, which in some specimens begin with the <span class="sans
  fwb">&Lambda;</span>-shaped mark between the shoulders. Dark spots on the flanks are very
  variable; the hind-limbs show the usual darker cross-bars, and the temporal region has the
  conspicuous dark patch. The ground-colour of the under parts is whitish, suffused with a pink
  tinge, and the throat is much speckled with brown; the toes are pink. The size of this pretty frog
  amounts to 2 inches. The breeding time is the month of March. When caught and squeezed they emit a
  slight "co-co-co."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page259"><span class="smaller">{259}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>R. graeca</i> inhabits Italy and the Balkan peninsula from Rosina to Morea, together with
  <i>R. agilis</i>, from which it is very difficult to distinguish except that it is a little
  smaller, remaining below 2&frac12; inches, and is generally more uniformly pale grey brown to yellowish
  and pinkish brown above, with scarcely any, or only a few, small dark specks on the back and
  limbs. The temporal patch is likewise paler than in the other species. The flanks are spotless,
  their colour gradually passing into the light buff of the under parts, which are more or less
  marbled with grey. The iris is golden, speckled with dark brown.</p>

  <p><i>R. latastei</i> of Lombardy and Northern Italy down to Florence is the last of these closely
  allied frogs. Its affinities lie with <i>R. iberica</i> and <i>R. agilis</i>. The latter and <i>R.
  latastei</i>, although living side by side in the same locality, for instance near Turin, are said
  not to interbreed. The voice is a rapidly uttered "keck-keck-keck;" the length remains below 2&frac12;
  inches. The ground colour is greyish or reddish brown with a dark brown <span class="sans
  fwb">&Lambda;</span>-shaped mark between the shoulders, and a few red, orange, or blackish spots
  on the back. The flanks are without definite dark spots. The under parts are whitish, with a
  strong pink tinge, especially along the middle of the throat and on the chest, the paler portions
  being mottled with pale grey brown.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the least unsatisfactory way of distinguishing between <i>R. agilis</i>, <i>R.
  graeca</i>, and <i>R. latastei</i> (<i>R. iberica</i> need not be confounded with them on account
  of its distribution) is the size of the tympanum, and its distance from the eye. The tympanum is
  smallest in <i>R. graeca</i>, its diameter being about half that of the eye and from &frac34; to the
  whole of its width distant from the eye. In <i>R. latastei</i> the tympanum is a little larger,
  and about &frac12; to &#x2154; its own width distant from the eye. <i>R. agilis</i> has the largest
  tympanum, measuring about &frac34; of the diameter of the eye, and the distance between the two organs
  amounts to only &#x2153; of the size of the tympanum.</p>

  <p>Brown land-frogs of the <i>R. temporaria</i> group are found in most countries of nearly the
  whole Periarctic and Oriental regions, and by the time their races and varieties have been studied
  as minutely as those of Europe are now being scrutinised, the number of species will indeed be
  great.</p>

  <p><i>R. silvatica</i> is the chief representative in North America. It closely resembles <i>R.
  agilis</i>, but is smaller, only 2 inches in length, <span class="pagenum" id="page260"><span
  class="smaller">{260}</span></span>and possesses a pair of internal vocal sacs. Its specific name
  refers to its predilection for forests of oak, among the dried leaves of which it conceals itself
  so successfully that it is discovered with difficulty. <i>R. japonica</i> of Eastern Asia is
  almost indistinguishable from this American species and from the European <i>R. agilis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>R. opisthodon</i> of the Solomon Islands has the vomerine teeth in two oblique series
  entirely behind the level of the choanae. The general shape of this large frog is stout, the type
  specimen of the male measuring 78, that of the female 125 mm. = 5 inches. The upper surface of the
  female is covered with small, flat warts, that of the male is much smoother. The upper parts are
  dark brown, while the under surface is brownish white. The male has two internal vocal sacs.</p>

  <p>This species is interesting as affording another instance of shortened development, the whole
  metamorphosis being gone through within the egg. Mr. Guppy, its discoverer, has supplied the
  following notes: "During a descent from one of the peaks of Faro Island I stopped at a stream some
  400 feet above the sea, where my native boys collected from the moist crevices of the rocks close
  to the water a number of transparent gelatinous balls, rather smaller than a marble. Each of these
  balls contained a young frog, about 4 inches in length, apparently fully developed, with very long
  hind-legs and short fore-legs, no tail, and bearing on the sides of the body small tufts of what
  seemed to be branchiae. On my rupturing the ball or egg in which the little animal was doubled up
  the tiny frog took a marvellous leap into its existence, and disappeared before I could catch it.
  On reaching the ship an hour after, I found that some of the eggs which I had put in a tin had
  been ruptured on the way by the jolting, and the liberated frogs were leaping about with great
  activity. On placing some of them in an open-mouthed bottle, 8 inches long, I had to put the cover
  on, as they kept leaping out."</p>

  <p>Boulenger<a id="NtA_115" href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> has figured and further described
  the eggs and young. The egg measures 6-10 mm. in diameter, and is a transparent capsule in which
  the young frog is coiled up in the same way as figured by Peters in <i>Hylodes martinicensis</i>;
  but none of the specimens, which are in an advanced stage of development, show anything of a tail.
  There are no gills, but on each side <span class="pagenum" id="page261"><span
  class="smaller">{261}</span></span>of the abdomen are several regular transverse folds, the
  function of which is probably that of breathing organs, like the tail of <i>Hylodes</i>. The tip
  of the snout is furnished with a small conical protuberance projecting slightly through the
  delicate envelope of the egg, and evidently used to perforate that envelope.</p>

  <p><i>R. guppyi</i>, likewise an inhabitant of the Solomon Islands, is a giant among frogs. It was
  discovered by Mr. Guppy on the Shortland Islands. The type-specimen measures 165 mm. = 6&frac12; inches
  in length! The skin of the upper parts is covered with minute warts, and forms a strong fold above
  the distinct, but small, tympanum. General colour dark olive brown above, dirty white below.</p>

  <p><i>R. tigrina</i> is a common species of Eastern Asia, including the Malay Islands. On account
  of the strength of its voice, and its size, which is said to reach 7 inches, it is called the
  "Indian Bullfrog." Mainly aquatic, it has a strong cutaneous fringe along the outer side of the
  fifth toe. The skin of the back is thrown into longitudinal folds, and a strong fold marks the
  upper border of the tympanum. The general colour above is olive brown, with dark spots, often with
  a light vertebral line; the under parts are white. The male has a pair of large external vocal
  sacs.</p>

  <p><i>R. gracilis</i> has the same distribution, but it remains much smaller, and the toes are
  only half, instead of fully, webbed.</p>

  <p><i>R. catesbiana</i> is now the settled name of <i>the</i> "Bullfrog" of North America, the
  much more appropriate name of <i>mugiens</i> having been sacrificed to the fetish of priority. The
  tympanum is extraordinarily large, at least equal to the size of the eye, largest in the male. The
  first finger does not extend beyond the second; the toes are connected by a broad web down to the
  ends, and there is a small inner, but no outer, metatarsal tubercle. The upper parts are olive
  brown, clouded with dark brown or blackish spots; the under parts are yellowish white, often
  marbled with brown, especially on the throat. The iris is reddish, with an outer yellow ring. The
  male possesses two internal vocal sacs. Total length of adult specimens about 5 inches, but there
  are giants on record 7 inches in length, while the stretched hind-limbs measure another 9 or 10
  inches. Its home extends over the whole of the United States, East of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page262"><span class="smaller">{262}</span></span>Rocky Mountains, southwards into Mexico,
  northwards into Canada.</p>

  <p>According to Holbrook the Bullfrogs are solitary in their habits, only collecting together in
  the breeding season, when hundreds may be seen in the same small pond; and then the croak uttered
  by the males is so loud as to resemble the distant roaring of a bull, and can be heard on still
  evenings at a distance of half a mile. The voice is a hoarse bass "brwoom," playfully translated
  into "more rum." "They cannot be said to abound, but are found commonly enough sitting half
  immersed in water, or on the banks of ponds, waiting for their prey. If alarmed they hop suddenly
  into the water, but do not conceal themselves at once, frequently skimming along the surface for
  several yards before they dive below." They are the most aquatic of all the North American frogs,
  and Holbrook has known specimens to live in wells for years, where they could not rest a moment on
  solid ground above the water.</p>

  <p>The Bullfrog is voracious, and takes almost anything that lives or gets into his own
  pond&ndash;Mollusca, Crustacea, fishes and, above all, frogs. There is no doubt that they drag
  down and swallow a good many ducklings and the young of other water-fowl, but certainly not the
  half-grown birds which have a way of disappearing from the farms wherever there are negroes and
  other farm-hands about. In turn the bullfrog has sufficient enemies to keep its numbers down, in
  fishes, birds, otters, and snakes, and, in the South, alligators. Although easily kept and growing
  comparatively tame, they are dull, having to be kept in solitary confinement on account of their
  greediness, which knows no limits. Two of our specimens each swallowed a full-grown <i>Salamandra
  maculosa</i>, and died within the same night, probably not understanding the meaning of the
  conspicuous black and yellow warning colours of the European.</p>

  <p><i>E. clamata</i> s. <i>fontinalis</i>, likewise an inhabitant of Eastern North America, may be
  called a smaller edition of the Bullfrog, its usual full-grown size being about 3&frac12; inches. The
  tympanum is conspicuously large, but the toes are webbed to a lesser extent, and the skin forms a
  glandular fold which extends from the shoulder in a curve to the flank. This species is partial to
  the neighbourhood of running streams; it is said to be <span class="pagenum" id="page263"><span
  class="smaller">{263}</span></span>exceedingly timid, and to utter a short cry when disturbed and
  making its enormous leaps.</p>

  <p>Another North American relation is <i>R. halecina</i> s. <i>palustris</i>, frequenting the
  neighbourhood of ponds and rivers, very lively and capable of jumping 8 to 10 feet. The tympanum
  is smaller than the eye, but there is the same glandular lateral fold as in <i>R. clamata</i>. The
  vocal sacs are internal and decidedly small.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>R. esculenta.</i>&ndash;The common Water-frog of nearly the whole Palaearctic region is
  closely allied to the American Water-frogs described above, and, like most of them, has the
  vomerine teeth in two small oblique rows between the choanae and extending a little beyond their
  posterior border. But the males have a pair of external vocal sacs. The tympanum is distinct,
  about two-thirds the size of the eye. The first finger is slightly longer than the second. The
  toes are entirely webbed. Besides the usual subarticular phalangeal tubercles, the sole of the
  foot is provided with two metatarsal tubercles, the outer of which is very small, while the inner
  is much larger, although varying in size from a soft oval to a long, curved, shovel-shaped
  structure. The skin is smooth, except for a pair of prominent glandular folds which extend from
  behind the eye along the dorso-lateral line. The coloration varies considerably. The upper parts
  are mostly greenish brown, with black brown spots on the back, and larger patches on the limbs.
  Most specimens have three lighter stripes along the back, the middle one mostly green, the two
  lateral bronzy brown and coinciding with the glandular folds. The tympanum is brown, and there is
  occasionally a dark temporal patch. The posterior aspect of the thighs is invariably <span
  class="pagenum" id="page264"><span class="smaller">{264}</span></span>spotted with black and white
  or yellow, in opposition to the <i>R. temporaria</i> group, where these parts are never
  spotted.</p>

  <p>The total length of this species varies much. Specimens 2&frac12; inches in length are certainly
  mature, those of 4 inches are unusually large, and Boulenger has received a giant from Damascus,
  which measured 125 mm., or nearly 5 inches. The females are larger than the males.</p>

  <p>The variations in colour are not only local but also individual, moreover the colours are
  changeable. The ground-tint ranges from dull brown through olive to bright green, the dark spots
  being more or less pronounced and numerous; the light vertebral line is olive-yellowish, bright
  green, or altogether absent.</p>

  <p>Those which inhabit waters with plentiful vegetation, like water-lilies and other luxuriant
  plants, are generally prettier and more vividly coloured than those which live in swamps and ponds
  with dark mud, or where the prevailing vegetation has a sombre aspect. Cold and dull, warm and
  sunny days also influence the water-frogs, and those which have been kept in a dark tank look very
  different from the bright assembly which had been put in some weeks before.</p>

  <p>Various attempts have been made at subdividing <i>R. esculenta</i> of Linnaeus into
  sub-species, and Boulenger has now, after the attentive study of an enormous material, arranged
  them in four principal and recognisable races. The chief differences are the relative length of
  the femur to the tibia and the size of the metatarsal tubercles.</p>

  <p>1. Var. <i>ridibunda</i>, Pallas.&ndash;The right and left heels overlap each other when the
  thighs are stretched out at right angles to the vertebral column, and the tibia is closely folded
  up against the thighs. When stretched forwards, the heel reaches the eye or even the tip of the
  snout. The inner metatarsal tubercle is feebly developed, very small and blunt; the outer tubercle
  is absent.</p>

  <p>That part of the thighs which is concealed by the legs when the animal is at rest is whitish or
  pale greenish, marbled with dark olive, or bronze, or of the latter colour with or without small
  light spots. No trace of yellow is ever to be detected on that region, nor at the axillae or on
  the groin. The vocal sacs are strongly pigmented with black, when inflated they are pale grey. The
  iris is a mixture of black and gold.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page265"><span class="smaller">{265}</span></span></div>

  <p>This form or race has the widest distribution, namely, all over Europe with the exception of
  England, the northern half of France, the Rhine countries, Denmark, and Italy. Southwards it
  extends from France through Spain and Portugal into the Sahara, eastwards into Turkestan. It
  attains a larger size than the others, but only in certain localities in various countries, where
  circumstances favour its development. Eastern countries produce the largest of all; those of the
  Volga are said to be very large. German physiological laboratories prefer those from the Danube,
  from Bohemia, and from the lakes and broad expansions of the Spree, to specimens from other
  localities.</p>

  <p>2. Var. <i>typica</i> (<i>esculenta</i>, Linnaeus).&ndash;The heels just meet, but do not
  overlap. The inner metatarsal tubercle is strong, compressed, and prominent. A small outer
  tubercle is present. The heel reaches to the eye or a little further; the hinder surface of the
  thighs is "marbled with black, usually with more or less bright yellow pigment" in the living
  specimens; the vocal sacs are white or feebly pigmented. This race inclines to rather more green
  than the others, the males especially are often dark grass-green, with scarcely any markings. The
  vertebral stripe is then yellowish, and the lateral stripes almost golden. The range extends over
  the whole of Central Europe and the kingdom of Italy. Its northern limit is the southern end of
  Sweden. In the greater portion of Germany, Poland, and Austria it overlaps the var.
  <i>ridibunda</i>, with which it does not seem to pair, owing to a difference in the time of
  spawning; the var. <i>typica</i> being about a fortnight later, and beginning to spawn when the
  other has finished.</p>

  <p>3. Var. <i>lessonae</i>, Camerano.&ndash;Except that the inner tubercle is stronger, while the
  outer one is near the vanishing point, and that the fourth toe is proportionally longer, this
  variety is really not distinguishable from the typical form, and Boulenger himself confesses that
  the distinction is arbitrary. The var. <i>lessonae</i> seems to have a rather sporadic
  distribution. It has been found in Piedmont and other parts of Italy, in Hungary and Transylvania,
  near Vienna, Halle, Upper Bavaria, on the Rhine, near Brussels, Paris, and what is of especial
  interest to us, in a few places in the eastern counties of England.</p>

  <p>According to Boulenger's "Notes on the Edible Frog in England,"<a id="NtA_116"
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> the individuals of <i>R. esculenta</i> which live in Foulmire
  <span class="pagenum" id="page266"><span class="smaller">{266}</span></span>Fen in Cambridgeshire,
  near Stow Bedon, and between Thetford and Scoulton in Norfolk, and are generally supposed to have
  been introduced from France, belong to the Italian form of var. <i>lessonae</i>. "It used to be
  found in Cambridgeshire, in Foulmire Fen, where it was discovered in 1844; and Bell<a id="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> assures us that his father, who was a native of
  Cambridgeshire, had noticed the presence of these frogs many years before at Whaddon and Foulmire,
  where they were known from their loud croak as 'Whaddon organs' and 'Dutch nightingales.' The
  species was afterwards rediscovered in Norfolk, between Thetford and Scoulton, where it is now
  still very abundant, and from inquiries made by Lord Walsingham, must have existed for the last
  seventy (80) years at least. These frogs belong to the var. <i>lessonae</i>, and differ widely (by
  the much stronger inner metatarsal tubercle) from those found in a few other places in Norfolk,
  which are undoubtedly the descendants of a number imported from France and Belgium in 1837, 1841,
  and 1842, and turned loose in the Fens at Foulden and in the neighbourhood.... Within the last ten
  years large numbers of all the three forms have been imported from Brussels, Berlin, and Italy,
  and liberated in various localities in West Surrey and Hampshire. Berlin specimens of the var.
  <i>ridibunda</i> have also been introduced in Bedfordshire, and Italian ones in Oxfordshire."<a
  id="NtA_118" href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Leaving aside the question whether the so-called var. <i>lessonae</i> is merely sporadically
  developed out of the typical form, the inquiry of the possible origin of the English specimens of
  the var. <i>lessonae</i> is of special interest. Have they been introduced, as has been suggested,
  from Lombardy, or are they the last lingering descendants of native English frogs? The suggestion
  as to their Italian origin has naturally lost in value since similar specimens have been found in
  Belgium and near Paris; but we must remember that there existed considerable intercourse between
  East Anglia and the monks of Lombardy, who, to mention only one instance, came regularly to the
  old Priory of Chesterton, near Cambridge, in order to collect their rents. If the frogs were
  introduced by them for culinary purposes into various suitable localities their descendants would
  remain as local as they, and as the undoubtedly introduced French typical specimens actually are.
  On the other <span class="pagenum" id="page267"><span class="smaller">{267}</span></span>hand, if
  we assume the <i>lessonae</i> specimens to be the last living descendants of English natives, it
  is inconceivable why they should now be restricted to that eastern corner while there are hundreds
  of other suitable places in England and Wales which, if on the Continent, would be perfect
  paradises for Water-frogs. The same vegetation, the same insects, the same climate, and&ndash;an
  enormous advantage to the frogs&ndash;no storks.</p>

  <p>These English specimens are "olive-brown or bronzy-brown above, with black spots, strongly
  marked on the flanks, where a light longitudinal area remains unspotted; glandular folds lighter;
  the sides of the head and the ground colour of the flanks are sometimes green; tympanum
  chestnut-brown; a pale yellow or pale green vertebral line, frequently edged with black; the dark
  cross-bands on the limbs usually very irregular, sometimes absent; lower surfaces more or less
  profusely spotted with blackish; iris golden. Length of a male from Stow Bedon, 64 mm. or 2&frac12;

  Distribution from Corea and Japan to Siam.</p>

  <p>All these Water-frogs are decidedly aquatic. They make short excursions on land when their
  homes are dried up, but as a rule they remain in the lake, pond, river, morass, or ditch in which
  they were born. Their favourite resorts are the broad floating leaves of water-plants, for
  instance water-lilies, or a prominent stone, a tussock of grass, or the banks of their homes,
  where they sit motionless, basking for hours in a half-erect, alert position, watching for insects
  and other small fry, which are secured by a jump, and then lapped up. Sunshine is sure to bring
  them out, and on our approach they make straight for the water, either by one tremendous leap or
  with quick bounds, but without the slightest hesitation or stopping on the way. With folded arms
  they take a header, swim, with the arms still folded, for some distance under water, and conceal
  themselves in the mud, between stones, or in the vegetation. We perhaps have not seen them at all,
  whilst their watchful eyes and keen ears have noticed our approach, and the pond might appear
  uninhabited if we had not heard the plumping noise. If we <span class="pagenum" id="page268"><span
  class="smaller">{268}</span></span>keep quite still, and they have not been disturbed previously,
  one after another will wriggle out of the mud, rise slowly to the surface under cover of the
  plants, and, without causing a ripple, rise just enough for the prominent eyes and the nose to
  clear the surface. Then one scrambles partly on to a leaf, but the sight of the huge human figure
  strikes him as uncanny, as it certainly does not belong to the scenery, and he doubles back, the
  broadly-webbed feet making a little splash. But another appears, jumps on to a leaf in the middle,
  or at the farther end of the pond, settles down, and utters a little croak, somewhat like "ooaar,"
  and soon the whole company appear one after another, each taking up its favourite position. After
  all, their observing powers cannot be very great. If we ourselves keep still we may wield a rod
  and fish for them. There is no need of a hook, a piece of red cloth tied to the end of the line
  and skimmed over the water causes a lively commotion. The new bait is noticed at once, and arouses
  their curiosity; several jump at it, and the one which swallows the bait can be lifted out before
  it has time to let go. However, this is after all poor sport; the game is too eager. When a boy I
  have often caught them with a noose of slender wire at the end of a long hazel rod. They do not
  mind the rod at all, their attention being fixed on the person; they allow the noose to be slipped
  over their heads, and a sudden jerk secures the captive. In this way they can be singled out
  individually. Old frogs are more wary and experienced than the younger members; they take up safer
  positions, and by their sudden plunges give the alarm.</p>

  <p>The males are great musicians, singing for sheer enjoyment not only during the pairing time,
  but throughout the months of June and July. Warm moonlit nights are the favourite times <span
  class="pagenum" id="page269"><span class="smaller">{269}</span></span>for the concert, which takes
  place in the water, beginning at sunset, and continuing until the early dawn. A few individuals
  here and there utter a single note, "gwarr, oo-arr," or "coarx," but these are only preliminaries.
  The precentor&ndash;the country-folk in North Germany firmly believe that in each pond one old
  male holds the dignified position of choir-master&ndash;begins with a sharp-sounding "brekeke,"
  and this is the signal for all the others to chime in with the same notes, varied with all sorts
  of other sounds, bass, tenor, and alto, each performer filling its resounding vocal sacs to
  bursting size, and these bags then look as if they acted as floats. When there are several hundred
  of these sociable creatures, the din is continuous, and may be heard more than a mile off. There
  can be too much of this, just as there can be too many nightingales; and a well-stocked pond in
  the neighbourhood may become a perfect nuisance. There are accounts of servants having been
  employed in the Middle Ages for the sole purpose of keeping the noise down by beating the pond,
  throwing stones into the water, or otherwise disturbing the frogs. Sometimes more vigorous and
  lasting measures seem to have been taken; the monks exorcised them in order not to be disturbed in
  their vigils. Near the former monastery of Chorin, in the province of Brandenburg, the frogs have
  still the reputation of keeping very quiet on account of some powerful abbot who threatened them
  with awful consequences if they did not forego their concerts.</p>

  <p>The length of life which these frogs can attain is quite unknown. They do not reach maturity
  until the fourth or fifth year, but this is long before they stop growing, and it is no
  exaggeration to say that few, if any, frogs die of old age, since they have so many enemies. The
  stork is their king in the fable, and his daily visits to his realm strike dire distress amongst
  his subjects, which soon learn to know his conspicuous white and black garb, and seek imperfect
  safety at the bottom of shallow ponds and ditches, not too deep for the long-legged and
  long-billed despot. Numbers are taken by birds of prey; snakes and tortoises hunt them up in the
  water, and they are good bait for pike and other voracious fishes. The specific <span
  class="pagenum" id="page270"><span class="smaller">{270}</span></span>name <i>esculenta</i> needs
  no comment, and this species is as much a martyr to science as the brown Grass-frog. The
  destroyers of tadpoles and young frogs are unlimited. In their turn the frogs themselves,
  especially the old ones, are very rapacious, and eat any living creature they can
  master,&ndash;insects, worms and snails, other frogs, especially the brown kind, and the young
  brood of fishes.</p>

  <p>Recently caught Water-frogs are wild beyond description, much more so than the Grass-frog, but
  even they calm down after some time, learn to know their keeper, and allow him to handle them
  without trying to commit suicide by jumping on to, into, and down anything. However, they do not
  thrive well in captivity, and it is rare that they can be induced to breed, unless their enforced
  new home affords them ample freedom, and plenty of water and fresh air.</p>

  <p>The Water-frogs appear in Germany rather late in the year, not before the middle of April,
  first the younger, then the adult members. In Southern Europe they show themselves earlier, and
  still further south they do not hibernate at all. The breeding season begins in Germany towards
  the end of May and continues well into June, the var. <i>ridibunda</i> beginning mostly a
  fortnight earlier. The male clasps the female under the arms, throwing its own round her breast,
  the nuptial grey excrescences on his inner fingers pressing against her skin, the palms being
  turned outwards. The embrace does not last long, rarely extending over a few days. The eggs, to
  the astonishing number of 5000 to 10,000 in full-grown specimens, are expelled in several masses,
  which sink down and remain at the bottom. The eggs measure only 1.5 mm. and are yellowish-grey
  above, pale yellow below; their gelatinous cover swells to 7-8 mm. in width. The embryo escapes on
  the fifth or sixth day as a very small larva, in which, however, the mouth, eyes, and beginnings
  of the external gills are already discernible. At the age of two weeks the gills have shrunk away,
  the left-sided "spiracle" is completed, and the well-tailed tadpoles, olive brown above, yellowish
  white below, still hang with their suckers on to plants and stones, or lie at the bottom, nibbling
  away at any rotting animal matter or scraping off the green algae.</p>

  <p>It may here be mentioned that small tadpoles of any kind can with advantage be used as cleaners
  of delicate and small <span class="pagenum" id="page271"><span
  class="smaller">{271}</span></span>skeletons. The object is put into a vessel, and the tadpoles
  will soon nibble and rasp away all the edible portions, leaving the skeletal framework beautifully
  cleaned. But they require attention lest they rasp away the cartilage.</p>

  <p>The tadpole stage lasts three to four months; but cold, absence of sunshine, and scarcity of
  food delay the metamorphosis well into the end of summer, or force them to hibernate in the
  unfinished condition. They are very gregarious, and when the tadpoles of several families combine,
  they make imposing shows. By the time that their hind-limbs begin to sprout, they frequently
  combine into large shoals, and instead of always feeding they swim about in their tens of
  thousands, all moving in the same direction, and making almost regular evolutions. Mill-ponds with
  steep banks are good places for watching these peculiar habits. The tadpoles reach a considerable
  size, the total length averaging 2&frac12; inches, or some 60 mm. the tail taking up &#x2154; of the
  whole length. Specimens which measure more than 3 inches are rare. The baby-frogs hop on land
  while still provided with a stumpy tail; when this is resorbed the little creature is scarcely
  half-an-inch long, and for the rest of the available season leads a rather more terrestrial life
  than ever after.</p>

  <p><i>Ex Africa semper aliquid novi!</i> Quite recently Boulenger has received a consignment of
  Anura from the French Congo, amongst which were several new, remarkable genera, notably
  <i>Trichobatrachus</i> and <i>Gampsosteonyx</i>. Both are true Ranidae. Pupil vertical, with
  vomerine teeth. Omosternum with a bony style. The outer metatarsals are bound together. In
  <i>Trichobatrachus robustus</i> the toes are webbed, and both sexes have the flanks and
  corresponding portions of the thighs covered with numerous darkly pigmented, filamentous,
  cutaneous excrescences; these are several millimeters in length, giving the flanks and thighs a
  "hairy" appearance. Mr. F. F. Laidlaw has examined these structures. Their most remarkable feature
  is the presence in them of a great number of ordinary flask-shaped cutaneous glands, whilst such
  glands are scarce on the surrounding skin. They differ in no way from those seen in sections of
  the skin of the Common Frog. The fibrous connective tissue is dense and vascular; the
  pigment-cells are most plentiful at the base. Contrary to expectation no nerve-endings were found
  in these filaments.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page272"><span class="smaller">{272}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Gampsosteonyx</i> has free toes. The terminal joints of the digits stand out beyond the
  skin, and end in sharp, bony claws, like those of a cat.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Dendrobatinae.</b>&ndash;About one dozen arboreal little frogs have been
  separated from the Raninae proper on account of the entire absence of teeth. This mere loss of
  teeth, and the geographical distribution suggest that these frogs do not form a natural group, but
  have been developed independently from other Ranidae, the Neotropical <i>Dendrobates</i> from some
  likewise Neotropical genus like <i>Prostherapis</i>, the Malagasy <i>Mantella</i> from an African
  form like <i>Megalixalus</i>.</p>

  <p>The sacral diapophyses are cylindrical. The omo- and meta-sternum are well developed. The
  fingers and toes are free, their terminal phalanges are <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped and
  carry regular, round, adhesive discs. The tympanum is distinct, although sometimes, in
  <i>Dendrobates</i>, very small. The pupil is horizontal.</p>

  <p><i>Dendrobates.</i>&ndash;The tongue is elongate, entire and free behind. The omosternum has a
  weak, semi-ossified style, but the metasternum remains cartilaginous. The males have a subgular
  vocal sac. Seven closely-allied species inhabit tropical America.</p>

  <p><i>D. tinctorius.</i>&ndash;This pretty little species, scarcely 1&frac12; inch in length, is quite
  smooth, varies much in coloration, and forms local races to a certain extent. Some are quite
  black, others are grey above, black on the sides and under parts; or they are grey with large
  black patches. A fourth variety is black above with several white or pink longitudinal stripes,
  while the under parts are grey, spotted with black. In others, again, the ground-colour is black,
  with white stripes and spots above, marbled below. But this enumeration does not exhaust the list,
  since living specimens are sometimes much more conspicuously coloured, some being black with large
  patches of saturated yellow on the head and back, while the limbs are orange red and black. This
  species has a wide range, from Panama to Ecuador and to the mouth of the Amazon. It owes its
  specific name to the peculiar use made by man of the strongly poisonous secretion of the tiny
  glands of the otherwise smooth skin. Other species are doubtless employed in the same way. The
  poison is mainly used for "dyeing" the green Amazon-parrots. This is done as follows:&ndash;The
  green and blue feathers on the head and neck, or other parts, according to the fancy of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page273"><span class="smaller">{273}</span></span>operator, are plucked out,
  and these places are rubbed with the poison, often simply with the living frog, certainly not with
  its blood, as is sometimes asserted. This operation may be repeated when the new, young feathers
  begin to bud. The result is that these appear yellow instead of green, and since the Brazilians,
  and to a certain extent the Portuguese, are rather partial to these artificially-produced freaks
  or "<span class="gsp">contrafeitos</span>" as they call them, the industry is kept up. That the
  poison is also used for arrows has been mentioned on <span class="wnw">p. <a

  </div>

  <p><i>D. trivittatus</i>, chiefly in Northern Brazil, has the first finger slightly longer than
  the second. It likewise varies considerably in its coloration, being either quite black, or
  spotted with white and brown, or with a whitish forehead and several white patches on the back and
  hind-limbs. <i>D. typographus</i> of Central America is vermilion red, with small dark marks on
  the back; the legs are black.</p>

  <p>The various species of <i>Dendrobates</i> take remarkable care of their young. <i>D.
  braccatus</i> lives in Brazil in "<span class="gsp">varzeas</span>," <i>i.e.</i> moist but
  waterless places, and carries its tadpoles on its back, to which they are attached by a peculiar
  secretion. The same is said to be true of <i>D. trivittatus</i>, which sits down in a drying-up
  puddle, lets the little tadpoles, when they are only 6-7 mm. long, fasten themselves on, and
  conveys them to a safer locality, where the water is calculated not to evaporate before the
  metamorphosis is completed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page274"><span class="smaller">{274}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Mantella.</i>&ndash;Both omo- and meta-sternum possess a bony style. The tongue is free and
  distinctly mitred or cut out behind. The skin is very granular. Several species, in Madagascar,
  were formerly put into the same genus as the American forms, until Boulenger established the genus
  <i>Mantella</i> for them. The coloration is strikingly pretty. <i>M. madagascariensis</i> is a
  rare instance of difference in colour between the two sexes. The male is bluish black, with light
  blue spots on the belly, while the thighs and the inner sides of the legs are beautifully red. The
  female is deep black, with a light green spot at the base and in front of the limbs; the rest is
  coloured like the male.</p>

  <p><i>Cardioglossa gracilis</i>, quite recently discovered at the Gaboon, has likewise to be added
  to the Dendrobatinae, on account of the absence of teeth. It is a small, slender, arboreal frog,
  bearing an unmistakable resemblance to the other genera by its general appearance and conspicuous,
  contrasting coloration of black and white.</p>

  CHARACTERS&ndash;POSITION OF THE CLASS REPTILIA IN THE PHYLUM
  VERTEBRATA&ndash;CLASSIFICATION&ndash;SKULL AND VERTEBRAE.</span></p>

  <p>The recent Reptiles comprise, broadly speaking, the Crocodiles, Tortoises, Lizards, and Snakes.
  They are the only Vertebrates which are cold-blooded, breathe by lungs, and have a median
  occipital condyle. Another equally sufficient diagnosis is the following:&ndash;Tetrapoda, with a
  median occipital condyle, with nucleated red blood-corpuscles, and with complete right and left
  functional aortic arches. A still shorter diagnosis is:&ndash;Monocondylia with a scaly skin.</p>

  <p class="sp3">If our diagnosis is to include the fossil Reptiles we have not only to discard the
  characters drawn from the soft parts as unavailable, but we are forced to treat the condition of
  the occipital condyle with caution, since there exist, or must have existed, transitional stages
  between Reptiles and Amphibia and Mammals; and the winged class Pterosauria does not permit us to
  use the wings as a differential character for the Birds. In fact, while the Reptilia are
  sufficiently separated from the Amphibia by their absolutely gastrocentrous vertebrae, it is
  difficult to distinguish them as a class from the Birds; hence the term <span
  class="sc">Sauropsida</span>, which is intended to indicate the close relationship of the Reptiles
  to the Birds in opposition to the Mammalia, and to the <span class="sc">Ichthyopsida</span> or
  Amphibia and Fishes. However, the Reptilia take up a very central position in the evolution of the
  main classes of the Vertebrata. On the one hand, there is not the slightest doubt that they are
  evolved from some branch of <span class="pagenum" id="page278"><span
  class="smaller">{278}</span></span>the Stegocephali, whilst on the other hand the Reptiles,
  probably through some branch of the Theromorpha, have given rise to the Mammals; some other
  Reptilian branch, at present unknown, has blossomed out into the Birds.</p>

  <p><b>Principal Characters of the Reptilia.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p>1. The vertebrae are gastrocentrous.</p>
    <p>2. The skull articulates with the atlas by one condyle, which is formed mainly by the
    basioccipital.</p>
    <p>3. The mandible consists of many pieces and articulates with the cranium through the quadrate
    bones.</p>
    <p>4. There is an auditory columellar apparatus fitting into the fenestra ovalis.</p>
    <p>5. The limbs are of the tetrapodous, pentadactyle type.</p>
    <p>6. There is an intracranial hypoglossal nerve.</p>
    <p>7. The ribs form a true sternum.</p>
    <p>8. The ilio-sacral connexion is post-acetabular.</p>
    <p>9. The skin is covered (<i>a</i>) with scales, but (<i>b</i>) neither with feathers nor with
    hairs; and there is a great paucity of glands.</p>
    <p>10. Reptiles are poikilothermous.</p>
    <p>11. The red blood-corpuscles are nucleated, biconvex, and oval.</p>
    <p>12. The heart is divided into two atria and an imperfectly divided ventricle. It has no
    conus, but semilunar valves exist at the base of the tripartite aortic trunk.</p>
    <p>13. The right and left aortic arch are complete and remain functional.</p>
    <p>14. Respiration is effected by lungs; and gills are entirely absent, even during embryonic
    life.</p>
    <p>15. Lateral sense-organs are absent.</p>
    <p>16. The kidneys have no nephrostomes. Each kidney has one separate ureter.</p>
    <p>17. There is always a typical cloaca.</p>
    <p>18. The eggs are meroblastic.</p>
    <p>19. Fertilisation is internal, and is effected, with the single exception of
    <i>Sphenodon</i>, by means of male copulatory organs.</p>
    <p>20. An amnion and an allantois are formed during development.</p>
    <div class="bq2">
      <p>Numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20 separate the Reptiles from the Amphibia. Cf. also pp.
      <a href="#page4">4</a> and <a href="#page5">5</a>.</p>
      <p>Numbers 9 (<i>b</i>), 10, 12, and 13 separate them from the Birds and Mammals.</p>
      <p class="sp0">Numbers 3, 8, and 11 separate them from the Mammals.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <b>evolution of the classification of the Reptiles</b> has to a certain extent been already
  treated on pp. <a href="#page7">7</a>-<a href="#page9">9</a>. For a long time only Chelonia or
  Tortoises, Ophidia or Snakes, and Saurii were recognised as their principal divisions. Then the
  Crocodiles were separated from the Lizards; later the Coeciliae were removed from the Snakes and
  referred to the Amphibia, <span class="pagenum" id="page279"><span
  class="smaller">{279}</span></span>and ultimately <i>Sphenodon</i> was recognised as deserving a
  separate position, equal in rank to the other groups. Stannius showed that the Crocodiles and
  Tortoises are relatively near allies in opposition to the likewise closely allied Lizards and
  Snakes (<i>Sphenodon</i> was then unknown), and he expressed this by the term Monimostylica, or
  creatures with fixed quadrate bones, for the former, and Streptostylica, creatures with movable
  quadrates, for the latter combination. The fossil Reptiles were hardly allowed proper places in
  the system. In various zoological text-books they were, or are even now, treated as inconvenient,
  outlying, or supernumerary members. A long time elapsed before, thanks to the labours of H. von
  Meyer, Owen, Huxley, Marsh, Cope, Zittel, and Seeley, it was recognised that the extinct groups
  form the preponderant mass of Reptiles, and that it is the recent groups which, in spite of the
  bewildering number of species of Lizards and Snakes, are the comparatively few and much-reduced
  members of a once flourishing class. With the exception of the Lizards and Snakes, which are on
  the ascending branch, the modern <i>Sphenodon</i>, the Crocodiles and the Tortoises are a mere
  fraction, comprising a few survivals of richly-developed groups, while all the others, the
  overwhelming majority, have died out.</p>

  <p>The families cannot well be changed, and terms like super-families and super-orders are
  sometimes resorted to by those who do not like to look stern facts in the face.</p>

  <p>The sequence of the groups, although arranged as much as possible in ascending order, is of
  necessity as unnatural as that of the maps in an atlas. We cannot yet construct a satisfactory
  phyletic tree of the Reptiles. The Proreptilia connect them with the Amphibia. Next follow the
  Prosauria with <i>Sphenodon</i> among the Prosauri as the key to most other groups. Then follow
  the Theromorpha, and it is probable that from various branches of these have arisen the Chelonia,
  Dinosauria, Crocodilia, and Plesiosauria. The descent of the Ichthyosauria is very problematic.
  The same applies to the Pterosauria and to the Pythonomorpha, but it is possible that they,
  together with the Sauria, are connected with the Prosauria.</p>

  <p>With all reserve these hypothetical affinities may be expressed by the following
  diagram:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The eleven sub-classes of the Reptilia present so many important differences that it is not
  advisable to give here a further general account of their structure. The diagrammatic figures A to
  T on <span class="wnw">pp. <a href="#page280">280</a></span>, <a href="#page281">281</a>,
  representing various types of skulls, are intended to explain their chief modifications, all
  referable to Proreptilian and to certain Theromorphous conditions. One of the most important
  features is that the mandible, which is always composed of many pieces (cf. Fig. 142, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page550">550</a></span>), is invariably carried by the quadrate bone.

  <p>As mentioned on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page278">278</a></span> the vertebrae of the
  Reptilia and those of all other Amniota are <i>gastrocentrous</i>; that is to say the centra or
  bodies of the vertebrae are formed by the pairs of interventralia, while the basiventralia are
  reduced, persisting either as so-called intercentra or wedge-bones, or as intervertebral pads, or
  disappearing altogether. At the earlier stages of development the gastrocentrous vertebrae behave
  in the <span class="pagenum" id="page284"><span class="smaller">{284}</span></span>same way as
  that described on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page12">12</a></span> (Fig. 1), except that the
  interdorsal elements are suppressed from the beginning. If the remaining three pairs of
  constituent elements of each vertebra (the basidorsalia, forming the neural arch; the
  interventralia, forming the body or centrum; and the basiventralia) remain separate, the vertebrae
  are called <i>temnospondylous</i> (<span title="temn&ocirc;"
  class="fsn">&tau;&#x03AD;&mu;&nu;&omega;</span>, I cut, <span title="spondylos"
  class="fsn">&sigma;&pi;&#x03CC;&nu;&delta;&upsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, a vertebra).
  If the neural arches and the centra are suturally united or are fused with each other, the
  vertebrae are called <i>stereospondylous</i> (<span title="stereos"
  class="fsn">&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&#x03CC;&sigmaf;</span>, solid). In many Amniota
  the atlas or first vertebra remains in a relatively primitive, embryonic condition, and is
  temnospondylous but for the usual modification that its centrum becomes attached to that of the
  second vertebra, and forms the odontoid process of the latter. The composition of gastrocentrous
  vertebrae (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page282">282</a></span>) is best illustrated by the
  first and second cervical vertebrae of the Crocodile (Fig. 56, <span class="smaller">3</span>,
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page283">283</a></span>).</p>

  <p class="sp5">Concerning <b>geographical distribution</b>, even a cursory study shows that the

  <p class="ac"><i>Permian Temnospondylous Reptiles with well-developed limbs and girdles of the
  terrestrial type.</i></p>

  <p>The two genera <i>Eryops</i> and <i>Cricotus</i> of the North-American Permian formation had
  until recently<a id="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> been relegated to the
  Stegocephali. By grouping them and their nearest allies together as Proreptilia it is intended to
  indicate that they are the lowest known Reptiles and that they probably link this class to the
  Amphibia. The superficial resemblance of their tri- or bi-partite vertebrae, and their occurrence
  in the Lower Permian, have caused the error of classing them with the Stegocephali, but the
  composition of their typically gastrocentrous vertebrae leaves no doubt as to their affinities.
  After all, we feel certain that Reptiles have arisen from Stegocephalous Amphibia, and it is in
  the Lower Permian, exactly where these debatable creatures lived side by side with Stegocephali,
  undoubtedly likewise temnospondylous, that the change from Amphibia into Reptiles seems to have
  taken place. Both are referable to Amphibia with quadripartite vertebrae. The condition of the
  occipital condyles determines nothing. This greatly exaggerated character has lost in importance
  since we have known the condylar modifications of the Theromorpha; moreover, <i>Cricotus</i>
  itself seems to have possessed a single condyle. We should even expect the Proreptilia to present
  many Stegocephalous inheritances, for instance the condition of the skull roofed in by dermal
  bones, a ventral dermal armour, a very complete pectoral arch still without a sternum, and only
  one sacral vertebra.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page286"><span class="smaller">{286}</span></span></div>

  <p>Until more genera are better known than they are now, it is premature to divide the present

      Fig. 56, 4, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page283">283</a></span>). <i>Cp</i>, Articular
      facet of the capitulum of a rib.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Eryops</i>, with several species in Texas and New Mexico. <i>E. megacephalus</i> is the most
  abundant and the largest species, its broad and flattened skull measuring more than 18 inches in
  length and 12 in width. With the exception of the nostrils and the small orbits, the skull is
  entirely encased in bone, with a rough, pitted surface, but without any distinguishable sutures.
  The absence of mucous canals, so common in the Stegocephali, is worthy of note. The quadrates
  extend obliquely outwards and backwards, so that the joint with the mandible lies in a plane
  behind the occiput. The mandibles are devoid of a projecting angular process. The teeth are
  numerous, small, and pointed. The vertebrae are typically temnospondylous, consisting each of
  three pairs of separately ossified pieces, which, although closely packed together, are not
  suturally connected. The neural arches possess high spinous processes, they articulate by short
  and broad zygapophyses and are, with their triangular bases, wedged in between the two ventral
  pieces, the posterior of which (the united interventralia) is in broader contact with the neural
  arch and lies behind it; the anterior piece (the united basiventrals) appear as typical, but
  large, intercentra, and bear on their posterior, dorsal margin the facets for the ribs. The latter
  are short, but are broad at their proximal ends, which are not bifurcated; they extend their
  articulation from the "intercentra" upon the short lateral processes of the neural arches. The
  tail is short and ends in a pointed coccyx, owing to fusion of the last vertebrae.</p>

  <p>The pubes and ischia are heavy, the former flattened and broadened out. The limbs are of an
  almost ideal pentadactyloid type; strongly developed for terrestrial locomotion. The ulna
  possesses a large olecranon. The carpus consists of ten separate pieces, ulnare, intermedium,
  radiale, two centralia and five distal carpalia. The latter support only four metacarpals and
  fingers, the second finger being completely abolished, an explanation suggested by Cope and
  corroborated by Emery.<a id="NtA_121" href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span class="smaller">{287}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Cricotus</i>, with several species in Texas and Illinois. <i>C. heteroclitus</i> was perhaps
  10 feet long and probably aquatic. The skull has a long, narrow, depressed snout, the margins
  overhanging those of the lower jaw; its surface is encased in dermal bones, most of which still
  show sutures, so that for instance postfrontals, postorbitals, supratemporals and squamosals can
  be distinguished; all these are in contact with the long parietals and with the quadrato-jugal
  arch, covering the temporal region; but the supratemporals have a free projecting border, like the
  squamosals of the crocodiles. According to Cope's description the basioccipital is connected with
  the first vertebra by an undivided discoid "intercentrum," probably the true centrum, while the
  first basiventral mass, which would be, if independent, the first true intercentrum, is more
  probably connected with the first neural arch, thus constituting the ring of the atlas.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are still temnospondylous, but no longer tripartite. The neural arch is fused
  with the interventralia into one mass, which carries the capitula and tubercula of the ribs, while
  the united basiventrals still remain as separate intercentral wedges. In the tail these wedges
  carry chevron-bones, and are enlarged into thick almost complete discs, or rather rings, while the
  whole vertebral column is still perforated, as also in <i>Eryops</i>, by the chorda dorsalis. The
  tail is long. The digits are devoid of claws.</p>

  <p>Remains of dermal armour exist on the throat in the shape of several large gular plates, while
  the whole belly is covered with many closely packed bony scales, which are arranged in
  chevron-shaped transverse rows.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Probably several other genera of American Permian and also of European Permian
  strata will, when better known and critically examined, have to be referred to the Proreptilia.
  Thus for instance the European <i>Melosaurus</i> may have affinities with <i>Eryops</i>, while
  <i>Diplovertebron</i> of Bohemia seems to be allied to <i>Cricotus</i>. The difficulty of division
  will lie with those Lower Permian Amphibia which, like <i>Archegosaurus</i>, <i>Euchirosaurus</i>,
  <i>Actinodon</i>, possess tripartite vertebrae, which at first sight are strikingly like those of
  <i>Eryops</i>. But the tail-vertebrae permit of no mistake, and since these are quadripartite in
  <i>Archegosaurus</i>, <i>Chelydosaurus</i>, and <i>Sphenosaurus</i>, these genera are safely to be
  classed with the Amphibia, unless, indeed, for mere argument's <span class="pagenum"
  id="page288"><span class="smaller">{288}</span></span>sake, it be assumed that the intercentral
  discs of <i>Diplovertebron</i> and <i>Cricotus</i> are formed by the fusion of Amphibian
  interdorsals with interventrals. Anyhow, simply to state that the tripartite vertebrae of
  <i>Eryops</i> are the same as those of <i>Actinodon</i>, would be as convincing as saying that the
  English and French flags are essentially the same, both containing the same colours, but one is
  white, red, and blue, the other blue, white, and red. Tripartite Amphibian vertebrae are composed
  of basidorsals + basiventrals + interdorsals, those of Reptiles are made up of basidorsals +
  basiventrals + interventrals. (Cf. Fig. 56, <span class="wnw">p. <a

  possession of two sacral vertebrae (<i>Petrobates</i>), the bifurcated ribs which always
  articulate with the centra (most clearly shown in <i>Orthocosta</i>), and the possession of five

  class="smaller">{289}</span></span>as the Proreptilia&ndash;it is not to be wondered at that they
  still retain a number of amphibian features. The skull is encased in dermal bones as in the
  Stegocephali, and the dermal armour of the trunk and tail is composed of many bony, sculptured
  scales, which cover back, sides, and under surface. The middle rows on the back are the largest,
  while the scales on the belly are arranged in transverse rows, which imbricate and converge
  obliquely headwards. Special gular plates seem to be absent. The skull has an interparietal
  foramen. The jaws and the palate are furnished with small, simple teeth, and there is a large
  parasphenoid bone, an eminently amphibian character. The occipital condylar articulation is
  supposed to be double. The centra of the vertebrae are deeply amphicoelous, elongated, and
  constricted in the middle, just like those of the Aistopoda and Branchiosauri. The dorsal spinous
  processes are strongly developed, and with the zygapophyses are very reptilian. Transverse
  processes are absent or very short, the tubercular portions of the ribs articulating with the
  centra, the capitula mostly intervertebrally, in any case close to the anterior end of the centra.
  The tail-vertebrae possess very typical, movable chevrons, placed intervertebrally, and bear an
  extraordinary resemblance to those of Geckos. The ribs are long and slender, but there is no
  sternum. The fore- and hind-limbs are pentadactyle, in opposition to the invariably four-fingered
  Stegocephali. The shoulder-girdle consists of scapulae, coracoids, clavicles, cleithra, and a
  <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle. The pelvis also resembles that of certain
  Stegocephali by the separately ossified, somewhat disc-shaped, flat ischia and pubes, which seem
  to have been joined together by cartilage into one broad mass.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Hylonomus</i>, Dawson's type of Microsauri, was found in the Coal-measures of
  Nova Scotia, within decayed tree-stumps. Closely allied, if not identical, but much better known
  is <i>Hyloplesion</i>, e.g. <i>H. longicostatum</i> of the uppermost Permian of Nyrschan in
  Bohemia. Total length under 4 inches; eyes with bony sclerotic rings; neck short. The truly
  Permian genera <i>Dawsonia</i>, <i>Melanerpeton</i>, <i>Orthocosta</i>, and <i>Seeleya</i> are
  allied forms, the last scarcely one inch in length, but well preserved. <i>Petrobates</i> of the
  Triassic Lower Red Sandstone of Saxony has an arrangement of the ventral dermal armour closely
  resembling abdominal ribs.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. PROSAURI</b></p>

  <p>Mostly extinct, chiefly Permian and Triassic, terrestrial, unarmoured reptiles with deeply
  biconcave vertebrae, numerous intercentra and chevron-bones, fixed quadrates, complete
  pentadactyle limbs and shoulder-girdle, entepicondylar foramina, acrodont teeth, and many small
  abdominal ossifications.</p>

  <p>The Prosauri differ from the Microsauri, with which they are closely allied, by the more
  advanced solidification of the vertebrae, the reduction of the tubercular portions of the ribs,
  the presence of an entepicondylar foramen in the humerus, and the loss of the dermal ossifications
  on the upper surface.</p>

  <p>Their ancestors are the Microsauri, whilst they themselves seem to be very near the root whence
  have sprung most, if not all, other main branches of the reptiles, notably Crocodilia, Dinosauria,
  and Sauria. In fact the Prosauri, although apparently few in number, seem to represent the central
  stem of the reptilian tree. Only one of them is still surviving, the famous <i>Sphenodon</i>, now
  represented by a single species in New Zealand.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Protorosauri.</b>&ndash;The ventral half of the pelvis seems to have formed one
  broad, continuous mass of cartilage in which the pubic bones are represented by a pair of oval,
  rather disc-shaped ossifications, while the ischia are more elongated. The pelvis consequently
  still bears a great resemblance to that of the Microsauri, and thereby also to the Stegocephalous
  condition, but the ilium seems to be attached to more than two vertebrae. The vertebrae are deeply
  biconcave, perhaps even with a persistent continuous chorda. The neural arches bear high,
  laterally compressed spines, but no diapophysial or lateral processes, the ribs being placed
  mostly intervertebrally and having lost their tubercular portions. The ribs are continued to about
  the sixth caudal vertebra. Intercentral wedges exist in an unbroken series between all the
  vertebrae from the atlas to the tail, where they are represented by movable chevrons. A costal
  sternum seems to be absent, unless it was quite cartilaginous. The shoulder-girdle is complete,
  consisting of a long interclavicle, clavicles, disc-shaped coracoids, and scapulae; but there are
  no cleithra, and no indication of precoracoids or even notches in the coracoids. The fore- and
  hind-limbs are complete and primitive, with five digits. The abdomen is protected by numerous
  oat-shaped little <span class="pagenum" id="page291"><span
  class="smaller">{291}</span></span>ossifications, which are arranged in many transverse or rather
  chevron-shaped rows, still greatly resembling the condition prevailing in the Microsauri, except
  that they have sunk deeper into the skin, being no longer directly covered by the scales. The
  skull, being no longer completely encased by bones, and possessing now wide supra- and
  infra-temporal fossae, appears at first sight much like that of a generalised lizard, except that
  it possesses three very conspicuous and distinct arcades in the temporal region: namely, the
  orbito-squamosal bridge across the temporal fossa, formed by the postorbital and squamosal; the
  arch formed by the squamosal with the postero-lateral buttress of the parietal; and the
  infratemporal arch or jugal bridge. The jugal itself is long, connecting the quadrato-jugal with
  the maxillary and lacrymal, and sending up an ascending process to the postorbital bone, thus
  taking a considerable share in the formation of the orbit. The quadrato-jugal is small, apparently
  fused with the quadrate, which itself is firmly overlaid by the squamosal. The quadrates are
  further fixed by being buttressed by the pterygoids, which rest upon short basisphenoid processes
  and extend far forwards, meeting the vomers and separating the palatines. The premaxillae are
  short, the nares small and terminal, the nasal bones are large. There is a small interparietal
  foramen. The teeth are acrodont and pointed, forming unbroken series on the premaxillaries,
  maxillaries, palatines and dentaries, and there are scattered little teeth on the vomers.</p>

  <p><i>Palaeohatteria longicaudata</i> from the Lower Red Sandstone of Saxony. Total length about
  18 inches, with six cervical, twenty trunk, three or four sacral, and about fifty caudal
  vertebrae. The teeth are ankylosed with the supporting bones. The five fingers have 2, 3, 4, 5, 3
  phalanges respectively. For the skull see Fig. 54, G, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page280">280</a></span>. <i>Telerpeton elginense</i> from the Triassic sandstone of
  Scotland, and perhaps <i>Saurosternon</i> of the South African Karroo sandstone seem to be
  allied.</p>

  <p><i>Protorosaurus</i> (<span title="pr&ocirc;tos" class="fsn">&pi;&rho;&#x1FF6;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  = first, <span title="&ocirc;ra" class="fsn">&#x1F64;&rho;&alpha;</span> = spring, or dawn, not
  <i>Proterosaurus</i>) apparently several species, e.g. <i>P. lincki</i> in the Upper Permian
  (marl-slate and magnesian limestone) of Thuringia and Durham. About 4 or 5 feet long, and in its
  general appearance rather like a Monitor-lizard, with about eight cervical vertebrae, most of
  which carry slender backwardly-pointing ribs, sixteen long-ribbed trunk-vertebrae, followed by
  three or four <span class="pagenum" id="page292"><span class="smaller">{292}</span></span>sacrals
  and more than thirty caudals, some of which have bifurcated spinous processes.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Rhynchocephali.</b>&ndash;The ventral pelvic bones resemble those of lizards
  and enclose a wide pubo-ischiadic foramen. There are only two sacral vertebrae. The abdominal ribs
  are closely packed, each transverse set consisting of only three rod-shaped pieces instead of many
  small oat-shaped nodules. The intercentra are sometimes suppressed in the trunk-region.</p>

  <p><i>Rhynchosaurus</i> from the Upper Trias of Warwickshire and Shropshire, and
  <i>Hyperodapedon</i> of the same age, found at Elgin, in Warwickshire, and also in Central India,
  are rather large, <i>H. gordoni</i> measuring 6 feet in length. Both have a short, broad, and
  stout cranium, and curved down, toothless premaxillae, hence the name Rhynchocephali; the nares
  are confluent; the teeth are numerous and small, and are liable to be worn down so that the
  animals ultimately bite with the edges of the jaws, to which the teeth are ankylosed. The
  premaxillaries of <i>Rhynchosaurus</i> are curved downwards over a slightly upcurved, likewise
  toothless process of the mandibles, which form a strong symphysis. All the teeth are very small,
  absent, or minute on the mandibles, forming one series on the maxillae, several rows on the vomers
  and especially on the palatines, which latter remain separated from each other.
  <i>Hyperodapedon</i> seems to have lost the intercentra; its vertebrae are solid, those of the
  neck are opisthocoelous. The interparietal foramen is likewise abolished. The hook-shaped end of
  the curved-down premaxillae fits into a bifurcation of the mandibles in front of their stout
  symphysis. The teeth are similar to those of the other genus. Whilst these, the earliest known
  genera of Rhynchocephali, are already in various ways rather specialised, <i>e.g.</i> the hooked
  beak and the loss of the intercentra, the two following fossil genera, although of much later
  date, namely Upper Triassic, are more closely allied to the recent <i>Sphenodon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Homoeosaurus pulchellus</i> and other species in Germany are only 6 to 8 inches long. The
  vertebral column consists of twenty-three presacral and many caudal vertebrae. The first five
  cervicals are devoid of ribs. Intercentra are restricted to the neck and the anterior portion of
  the tail. The mandibles are not fused together. The nares are divided by a bony septum. Each
  premaxillary has one rather broad tooth.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page294"><span class="smaller">{294}</span></span></div>

  <p>The teeth of the maxillaries and mandibles are triangular, much worn down in front. The ribs
  are devoid of uncinate processes. Closely allied but larger is <i>Sauranodon</i> of France, which
  has lost the upper teeth and uses the sharp margins of the jaws instead.</p>

  <p><i>Pleurosaurus</i> of Germany and France, about 5 feet in length, is remarkable for the
  shortness of its still pentadactyle extremities, for its short neck, and very long tail;&ndash;an
  interesting parallel to what has happened in many genera of recent lizards.</p>

  <p><i>Sphenodon</i> s. <i>Hatteria</i> is the sole surviving member of the whole group of
  Prosauria, and is represented by one species only, <i>S. punctatum</i>, in New Zealand. As the
  last living witness of bygone ages this primitive, almost ideally generalised type of reptiles,
  this "living fossil," deserves a detailed description.</p>

  <p>Total length of very large male specimens up to two feet and a half; in general appearance like
  many a stoutly built lizard. The general colour of the skin is dark olive-green with small white
  or yellowish specks on the sides. A series of slightly erectile spines of yellowish colour extends
  from the top of the head to the end of the tail, but is interrupted on the neck; they are
  cutaneous, covered with a thin sheath of horn. The under surface is covered with numerous scales,
  arranged in transverse rows; the rest of the body is rather granular. The tail is thick, slightly
  compressed laterally. The eye is large, dark brown, with a vertical pupil.</p>

  <p>Those who are satisfied with superficial resemblances still group this creature with the
  lizards, but it reveals itself as a primitive reptile or Prosaurian by the following characters,
  every one of which distinguishes it from the lizards:&ndash;The temporal region is bridged by
  three bony arcades. The large vomers, palatines, and pterygoids form a broad bony roof to the
  mouth; the large quadrates are firmly fixed by the pterygoids, squamosals, lateral occipital
  bones, and by the jugal bridge. The vertebrae possess an unbroken series of intercentral
  wedge-bones. There is an elaborate system of abdominal ribs. The humerus has an entepicondylar
  foramen, and there is also, in contradistinction to the fossil Rhynchocephalia, an ectepicondylar
  foramen for the passage of the radial nerve. The carpus still has the primitive number of ten
  bones, all of which remain separate, including the intermedium. Of soft parts are to be mentioned
  above all the entire absence of external copulatory organs, <i>Sphenodon</i> being the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page295"><span class="smaller">{295}</span></span>only recent reptile which is
  devoid of them; a most primitive condition, sufficient by itself to separate this creature from
  all the other living reptiles.</p>

  <p>The supratemporal bridge is formed by the squamosal and postorbital (Fig. 59, C, <i>Pt.f</i>),
  the latter being continued forwards and fused with the postfrontal (A, <i>Pt.f</i>). The
  postorbital joins the ascending branch of the jugal, both together forming the hinder border of
  the orbit; this is bordered below chiefly by <span class="pagenum" id="page296"><span
  class="smaller">{296}</span></span>the maxillary, which is long, while the anterior process of the
  jugal is much reduced. There is no pre-orbital fossa. The nares are terminal and lateral, well
  separated by the premaxillaries. The posterior temporal bridge is formed by the squamosal and
  parietal, the bridge extending laterally over the quadrate and enclosing a wide space between
  itself and the buttress-like expansion of the lateral occipital bone. The space enclosed between
  this occipital buttress, the quadrate, and the pterygoid support of the latter is likewise very
  large; it is of course the cavity of the middle ear, and as such is crossed by the columellar
  chain of the ear. The infratemporal bridge or jugal arch is formed by the jugal, which joins the
  descending process of the squamosal, and by the quadrato-jugal, which is small and fused with the
  quadrate. The latter is consequently very firmly fixed.</p>

  <p>The teeth are acrodont, ankylosed in one series with the supporting bones, triangular and much
  worn down in older specimens. Originally there seem to be several in the premaxilla, but the adult
  bite with the somewhat curved-down portions of the premaxillaries themselves, or with what remains
  of the fused bases of the original teeth, which then, together with the bone, look like one pair
  of large chisel-shaped incisors. The lateral edges of the palatines likewise carry teeth, those of
  the mandibles fit into the long slit-like space between the palatine and the maxillary teeth.
  Young specimens have a few small teeth on the vomers, which are large, and separate the long
  choanae from each other. The pterygoids form an anterior symphysis, posteriorly they rest upon
  short processes of the basisphenoid and send short flanges to the quadrates.</p>

  <p>The vertebral column is very primitive. The atlas is still typically temnospondylous. The first
  intercentrum or fused pair of basiventrals is broad and thick, and forms the ventral half of the
  atlas-ring, which articulates with the first centrum and with the second intercentrum. The
  irregularly shaped neural arches remain separate from each other and from the centrum; they carry
  on the dorsal side a pair of disconnected supradorsals, the so-called pro-atlas. The second
  intercentrum is fused with the first and second centrum. The second to ninth intercentra have low
  median ridges or knobs, and are as a rule more firmly attached to the cranial ends of the centra.
  Those of the trunk are small. From the third or fourth caudal vertebra <span class="pagenum"
  id="page297"><span class="smaller">{297}</span></span>backwards they appear as chevrons,
  articulating more with the vertebra in front than with the one behind. The bases of the right and
  left chevrons are frequently fused across so that the caudal canal is completely surrounded by
  bone, a feature common in Dinosaurs. Every intercentrum, be it a pair of chevrons, or an unpaired
  nodule, or crescent, extends dorsalwards into a fibro-cartilaginous ring which surrounds the
  chorda. The centra of the vertebrae are deeply amphicoelous, the cavity being filled throughout
  life by the chorda; but the middle of the centra is solid. Most of the caudal vertebrae are
  transversely divided into two parts, the posterior of which carries the greater share of the
  arches; they resemble in this respect those of lizards, and the lost tail is likewise reproduced.
  The first three ribs are represented by bands of connective tissue. The first is attached to the
  side of the first intercentrum; the second arises from the second intercentrum, and forms a small
  tubercle on the side of the second centrum; the third behaves similarly. The vertebral arteries
  and lateral strands of the sympathetic nerve-chain pass through these double basal attachments of
  the reduced ribs. The other ribs are osseous; they possess short capitula which retain their
  partly intercentral attachment, while the short tubercula are carried by low processes of the
  centra, not of the neural arches. Already in the thoracic region both capitulum and tuberculum
  merge into one facet, at first dumb-bell shaped, further towards the tail oval, gradually shifted
  backwards and dorsalwards upon the middle of the centrum, until the facet reaches and ultimately
  lies right across the neuro-central suture. The first few caudal vertebrae also possess ribs,
  which are however very short and fuse with the diapophyses, immediately below which lies the
  neuro-central suture.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The whole column consists of twenty-five presacral, two sacral, and about thirty caudal
  vertebrae. Some of the thoracic ribs have cartilaginous uncinate processes. Three or four pairs of
  ribs join a typical sternum, into the antero-lateral portion of which are let in the coracoids.
  The sternum is raised into a low median crest which fuses with the posterior branch of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page298"><span class="smaller">{298}</span></span><span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle, while the lateral branches of the latter fuse with the
  clavicles. The coracoids are broad and entire, still without fenestrae or notches indicative of
  precoracoids. The parasternum is very elaborate; it extends from the sternum to the pubic bones,
  and consists of about twenty-four transverse rows, each of which is composed of a median and two
  lateral splint-bones. They are irregularly shaped, partly with imbricating hooks, and are firmly
  attached to, in fact still connected with, the deeper portions of the cutaneous scales of the
  belly. The three pairs of pelvic bones are fused together at the acetabulum. Pubes and ischia each
  form one symphysis, and these are connected with each other by partly ossified cartilage and
  ligaments, so that the originally heart-shaped space is divided into a pair of ovals. The lateral
  processes of the pubes are thick, but very short. The ischia have postero-lateral processes. There
  is also a mostly cartilaginous, unpaired hypo-ischium.</p>

  <p>The fore- and hind-limbs are still primitive in structure; both pentadactyle. The carpus
  consists of ten, sometimes eleven pieces, according to the single or double nature of the central
  element. The proximal series is formed by the radiale, intermedian, and ulnare, with a pisiform.
  The ulna and radius remain separate. The humerus has the usual ectepicondylar in addition to the
  entepicondylar foramen common to all the Prosauri and Theromorpha. The hind-limbs are typically
  plantigrade.</p>

  <p>The tail is capable of regeneration, as in many lizards.</p>

  <p>The development of this reptile has recently been studied and described by Howes,<a
  id="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> who quotes the literature bearing upon the whole
  subject.</p>

  <p>A good account of the occurrence and habits of the "Tuatera" has been given by Newman.<a
  id="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> The Maoris call it "ruatara," "tuatete," or
  "tuatara," the latter meaning "having spines." Formerly common on the main islands of New Zealand,
  they are now apparently restricted to some of the islets in the Bay of Plenty, North Island.
  Bush-fires, wild pigs, dogs and cats, reptile-eating Maori tribes, and the advance of
  civilisation, have swept them away except on some of the small uninhabited islands, difficult of
  access, where they dig burrows, into which they retreat at the slightest sign of danger. They
  sleep during the <span class="pagenum" id="page299"><span
  class="smaller">{299}</span></span>greater part of the day, are very fond of lying in the water,
  and they can remain below for hours without breathing. They live strictly upon animals, but these
  are only taken when alive and moving about. The kind of food seems to vary according to the custom
  or fancy of the individuals. Sir W. L. Buller observed that some of his captives stubbornly
  refused to eat until one day, rather accidentally, minnows were offered. Others eat insects and
  worms; those which live near the seashore not improbably eat also crustaceans. From November to
  January they lay about ten eggs&ndash;white, hard-shelled, long and oval&ndash;about 28 mm. long,
  in holes in the sand, where they can be warmed by the sun. They are as a rule lazy in their
  movements. The usual pace is a slow crawl, the belly and tail trailing on the ground, but when
  chasing prey they lift the whole trunk off the ground. After running, or rather "wobbling" three
  or four yards, they grow weary and stop. They cannot jump the smallest obstacle.</p>

  <p>Von Haast<a id="NtA_125" href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> has carefully examined their
  habitations on the Chicken Islands. The Tuatara excavates its own hole, and this is shared
  sociably by various kinds of Petrels. The entrance to the chamber is generally 4 or 5 inches in
  diameter, and the passage leading into the inner chamber is 2 to 3 feet long, first descending and
  then ascending again. The chamber itself is one foot and a half long, by one foot wide and 6
  inches high, lined with grass and leaves. The petrel lives usually on the left side, the Tuatara
  on the right side of the inner chamber. Whilst very tolerant of the bird with its egg and young,
  it does not allow another of its own kind to live in the same hole, which it is ready to defend by
  lying in such a manner that the head is placed where the passage widens out into the chamber. On
  putting one's hand or a stick into the burrow the Tuatara bites at them furiously. They can run
  very fast, and defend themselves with great pluck against dog or man by biting or scratching. As
  soon as the sun has set they leave their holes to seek food. During the night, and especially
  during the pairing season, they croak or grunt.</p>

  <p>The eggs, having been deposited during the Southern summer, from November to January or
  February, in holes on a sunny and sandy spot, contain nearly ripe embryos in the following August.
  They are, however, not hatched until about thirteen <span class="pagenum" id="page300"><span
  class="smaller">{300}</span></span>months old. In the meantime they seem to undergo a kind of
  aestivation. The nasal chambers become blocked with proliferating epithelium, which is resorbed
  shortly before hatching.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I have kept half-a-dozen specimens in a green-house for several years, and have
  come to the conclusion that they are dull, not companionable creatures, in spite of their
  imposing, rather noble appearance when, with their heads erect, they calmly look about with their
  large, quiet eyes. Each dug its own hole in the hard ground underneath and between large stones.
  At dusk they sat in front of the holes or walked leisurely to the pan with the earthworms which
  formed their principal food. Meat they did not touch, but they killed and chewed up lizards and
  blind-worms. Sometimes they soaked themselves for many hours in the shallow, warm water. The skin
  is shed in flakes. I never found them basking in the sun, and the pineal eye, still so well
  developed in these strange creatures, caused them no distress when bright light was thrown upon
  it. They grew tame enough not to run away when found roaming about at night, but they did not like
  being handled, and they inflicted the most painful bites when taken up carelessly. The biggest, a
  male, was rather quarrelsome, grunted much, and worried the others.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i><span class="sc">Sub-Class III.</span>&ndash;THEROMORPHA.</i></p>

  <p>The Theromorpha comprise a great number of extraordinary, extinct reptiles, which as a group
  had a wide range in space and time. The earliest known occur in the Lower Red Sandstone of
  Thuringia and Bohemia, and in the middle Permian strata of Russia. The majority have been found in
  strata transitional between the Permian and the Triassic age, notably in the Karroo sandstone of
  South Africa and in corresponding levels of North America. Closely allied to them are those of the
  Triassic sandstone of Elgin in Scotland, and of India. They seem to have died out with the
  Muschelkalk or Middle Trias.</p>

  <p>The various genera exhibit such a diversity of structure, shape, and size, and many are still
  so imperfectly known, that <span class="pagenum" id="page301"><span
  class="smaller">{301}</span></span>any diagnosis is liable to be faulty, even assuming that they
  are a homogeneous group. To avoid confusion, we characterise the Theromorpha as <i>Reptiles with a
  firmly fixed quadrate, a single temporal arch, an interparietal foramen, and a pelvis in which the
  pubes and ischia form one stout, ventral symphysis</i>.</p>

  <p>The dentition is most abnormal, and permits the division of the Theromorpha into two or three
  main groups. In the Pareiasauri the teeth of the upper and lower jaws form rather even series of
  nearly equal size; smaller teeth are carried by the palatal bones. In the Theriodontia the teeth
  are differentiated in a truly Mammalian fashion into incisors, prominent canines, and multicuspid
  or tubercular molars. Each tooth, and this applies to all Theromorpha, is implanted in a separate
  alveolus; <i>Tritylodon</i> only seems to have double-rooted molars. The lower canines cross in
  front of the upper, just as in Mammals. In <i>Placodus</i>, which probably belongs to this
  assembly, the teeth are few in numbers, very broad and flat, especially those of the palate. In
  <i>Dicynodon</i> and <i>Gordonia</i> the teeth are restricted to a pair of conical, sometimes very
  large, tusk-like upper canines, and in <i>Oudenodon</i> the whole mouth is toothless.</p>

  <p>The configuration of the skull shows two main types. In the Pareiasauri it is completely roofed
  in by dermal bones, the only holes on the surface being the nostrils, orbits, and the
  interparietal foramen.</p>

  <p>The most striking feature of the second type of skull is the tendency to form an almost
  Mammalian zygomatic arch by the junction of the much elongated squamosal with the jugal bone, both
  abutting against a downward process of the postfrontal bone. The skull shows a pair of wide
  supratemporal foramina bordered by the parietals, squamosals, and postfrontals. The composition of
  the temporal arch varies considerably in detail, and in <i>Cynognathus crateronotus</i> at least
  there is a small hole within the arch, between the squamosal and jugal, probably the last remnant
  of the otherwise absent infratemporal foramen. Except in the roofed-in skulls of
  <i>Pareiasaurus</i> and <i>Elginia</i> there is no separate quadrato-jugal element. The quadrate
  is firmly fixed by the overlapping squamosal, and the whole pedicle for the support of the
  mandible is rather elongated, and either stands vertically or slants forwards. The mandible itself
  is compound. The pterygoids extend backwards so as to approach or reach the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span>distal portion of the quadrate; separate
  ectopterygoids do not seem to be developed. The shoulder-girdle consists on either side of a large
  scapula, which is mostly directed obliquely backwards, and is fused with the coracoid; a
  precoracoid is present or at least indicated by a notch or foramen; it is usually fused with the
  other bones. At least some genera possess a <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle
  and clavicles; <i>Pareiasaurus</i> possesses also a pair of cleithra.</p>

  <p>The pelvis is in every respect constructed upon the Mammalian plan. The three constituent parts
  meet at the acetabulum, and the ventral bones, pubes and ischia, form one broad symphysis, leaving
  two, sometimes very small, obturator-foramina. The ilium is attached to one to five sacral
  vertebrae, and since the whole pelvis slants obliquely downwards and backwards, this sacral
  attachment is distinctly pre-acetabular, perhaps most markedly so in <i>Dicynodon</i>. The limbs
  are mostly stout, humerus and femur with strong crests; the feet are thoroughly plantigrade, with
  five fingers and toes. The details of the carpus and tarsus are not well enough known to permit of
  generalisation, but there is a tendency to form a heel, and to develop the cruro-tarsal joint into
  the chief joint of the hind feet. The vertebrae are amphicoelous, sometimes with rather
  thin-walled centra, so that in these cases the chorda was continuous. Intercentral wedges, or
  basiventral elements, are frequent in the cervical and caudal regions. Most of the ribs,
  especially those of the neck, have a tuberculum attached to the neural arch, and a distinct
  capitulum which articulates either with the centrum or with the intercentrum, or lastly, if the
  latter is absent, between two centra. The axis and atlas vertebrae are united.</p>

  <p>The occipital condyle exhibits every stage between the single median knob (<i>Pareiasaurus</i>)
  formed almost entirely by the basioccipital bone, a triple condyle (<i>Dicynodon</i>) to which
  both lateral and the basioccipital bones contribute, and a kidney-shaped or double condyle
  (<i>Cynognathus</i>) from which the middle or basioccipital portion is more or less withdrawn.</p>

  <p>Dermal bony armour reached an extraordinary development on the head of <i>Pareisaurus</i> and
  <i>Elginia</i>; whether other parts of the body were protected is doubtful, but the flattened tops
  of the neural spines of <i>Pareiasaurus</i> suggest that they carried bony scutes. Abdominal
  protective ossifications are unknown. <span class="pagenum" id="page303"><span
  class="smaller">{303}</span></span>Many of the Theromorpha<a id="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> reached a considerable size, massive skulls of one foot in
  length being not uncommon. The tail was comparatively short.</p>

  <p>The many resemblances of these strange creatures to Mammals have naturally suggested that the
  Mammalia have sprung from some such Theromorpha or "beast-shaped" animals. The resemblances are
  chiefly the dentition, the zygomatic arch, the pelvis, the cruro-tarsal joint, the scapula which
  is sometimes possessed of a spine, and the occasionally double occipital condyle. The general
  shape of the skull of <i>Cynognathus</i> is indeed strikingly like that of a Carnivorous Mammal,
  and the shape of the whole body suggests rather a Mammal than a reptile; and when we have to deal
  with the fragmentary skulls of <i>Tritylodon</i> (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page309">309</a></span>) it is, indeed, difficult to decide to which of the two classes
  such a creature belongs. But the Theromorpha possess a number of important characters by which
  they reveal themselves at once as reptiles: (1) the large and fixed quadrate bone, which is still
  the sole support of the lower jaw; (2) the compound mandible, which is composed of at least an
  articular, dentary, angular, supra-angular, and splenial element; (3) the interparietal foramen;
  (4) the possession of prefrontal and postfrontal bones, sometimes also postorbital, supratemporal,
  and quadrato-jugal bones. Of course, any of these ancestral bones may be lost, and the
  interparietal hole may be closed as in tortoises and crocodiles. We can also imagine that the
  quadrate may be relieved of its jaw-bearing function and become loosened, but this is not easy,
  considering the strong development of the squamoso-quadrate pedicle. Those Theromorpha in which
  the quadrate itself is small, whilst the squamosal reaches down, or at least approaches the
  mandible, as in <i>Dicynodon</i> and <i>Gordonia</i>, are so hopelessly pledged, or specialised in
  other directions, that it is impossible to connect them ancestrally with Mammals.</p>

  <p>However, it is beyond reasonable question that the Mammals have sprung from some reptilian
  stock (the attempts to derive <span class="pagenum" id="page304"><span
  class="smaller">{304}</span></span>them from Amphibia, without the intervention of Reptiles, are
  as gratuitous as they have proved futile), and the Theromorpha undoubtedly comprise creatures
  which of all animals approach nearest to Mammals, and coincide with them in most important
  features. But we have not yet found a single Theromorph which can claim to be a direct ancestor of
  Mammals. Since the latter occur already in the Trias, we have to look for their reptilian
  forefathers at least in the Lower Permian, and this naturally excludes all the known forms. The
  filling up of this gap is but a question of time.</p>

  <p>The ancestry of the Theromorpha themselves is also shrouded in mystery. Attempts have been made
  to connect them with the Permian <i>Protorosaurus</i>, <i>Palaeohatteria</i>, and <i>Eryops</i>.
  On the other hand, some retain various Stegocephalous reminiscences (<i>e.g.</i> the roofed-in
  condition of the skull by membrane-bones, amongst which, besides others, supratemporals and
  postorbitals can be recognised; occurrence of cleithra in <i>Pareiasaurus</i>; distinct epiotic
  bones in <i>Elginia</i>). Although they have died out as a group, they have perhaps given rise to
  several side-branches, one of which (leaving aside the question of Mammalian origin) seems to have
  flourished as the Dinosauria.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We divide the Theromorpha into four orders, which are, however, liable to run into
  each other, and it is reasonably to be hoped that many forms may be discovered which will connect
  not only these provisional orders with each other, but also with other sub-classes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. PAREIASAURI</b></p>

  <p>Cranium completely roofed in by membrane-bones. The only foramina are the nostrils, orbits, and
  the interparietal foramen. The teeth are comparatively small, and stand in even series in both
  jaws.</p>

  <p><i>Pareiasaurus</i>, several species from the Karroo sandstone of South Africa. <i>P. baini</i>
  was an extremely clumsy brute, of most uncouth appearance, standing between 2 and 3 feet high, and
  measuring with the short tail nearly 8 feet in length. The skull is very massive, 18 inches long
  and slightly broader, with a rugose, deeply pitted surface. The teeth are thickly enamelled,
  serrated at the margin, with many pointed cusps; those <span class="pagenum" id="page305"><span
  class="smaller">{305}</span></span>of the vomer, palatines, and pterygoids are recurved and
  arranged in several longitudinal rows. There is a small incisive foramen in the premaxilla; the
  choanae lie within the pterygoids. The palate has a pair of large lateral vacuities. Between the
  squamosal and quadrate is a small foramen, as in <i>Belodon</i> and <i>Sphenodon</i>. The nares
  are terminal, bordered behind by the nasals, and divided by the premaxillaries. The occipital
  condyle is a single knob, but the lateral occipital bones also partake in its formation. The
  shoulder-girdle is strong. The scapula slants backwards, is broad, and possesses a longitudinal
  spine, an almost exclusively Mammalian character. The scapula, coracoid and precoracoid are fused
  together, and are united ventrally with those of the other side. There is a <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle, a pair of clavicles, and a pair of slender, long cleithra,
  which extend along the upper anterior margin of the scapulae. The humerus possesses enormous
  crests. The broad ilium is attached to two, or perhaps three, sacral ribs. The acetabulum is
  closed. The pubes and ischia are united into one broad mass of bone, and the obturator-foramina
  seem to be just large enough to permit of the passage of the nerve. Both fore- and hind-limbs are
  plantigrade and five-toed. The tibia articulates with one large bone, which is supposed to
  represent the united astragalus and calcaneum, the latter being without an indication of a
  prominent heel, although there is a tendency to develop the crurotarsal into the chief joint. The
  number of vertebrae amounts to eighteen presacrals, eight to ten of which are cervicals. There are
  two or three sacral and about twenty-four mostly shortened caudal vertebrae. The latter possess
  intercentral wedges and chevron-bones; wedges occur also between the cervical and some thoracic
  vertebrae. Some of the posterior cervical ribs are very peculiar&ndash;straight, broadened out,
  turned backwards, partly overlapped by one another, and 18 inches long, recalling the first two
  ribs of the crocodiles. Sternum and abdominal ribs are unknown.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Elginia mirabilis.</i>&ndash;The skull (Fig. 54, A, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page280">280</a></span>)&ndash;nothing else is known&ndash;indicates one of the most
  remarkable reptiles hitherto found on this side of the Atlantic. It was discovered in the Red
  Sandstone of Elgin (Lower Trias). The skull reminds us in its general shape and by its spikes and
  horns of the little American Iguanoid lizard, <i>Phrynosoma</i>. The length of the cranium is
  about 6 inches, the distance between the tips of the two largest <span class="pagenum"
  id="page306"><span class="smaller">{306}</span></span>horns measures 9 inches. The teeth are small
  and resemble those of an <i>Iguana</i> in their shape and finely serrated edges, indicating
  herbivorous habits, but there are also several rows of smaller teeth on the palate, the
  configuration of which is not unlike that of <i>Sphenodon</i>. The top and sides of the skull,
  except the interparietal foramen, the orbits, and nostrils, are completely encased by rugose,
  pitted, dermal bones, most of them with strange, horn-like spikes. In the encasement of the
  temporal region can be discerned a postfrontal, parietal and squamosal, a conically projecting
  epiotic, a postorbital and supratemporal, a jugal and a quadrato-jugal, which latter almost
  completely covers the quadrate bone. The interparietal foramen lies far forwards, almost on a
  level with the orbits. The nostrils are terminal, surrounded by the short nasals, the maxillaries
  and the premaxillaries, which latter divide them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. THERIODONTIA.</b></p>

  <p>The cranium is not roofed in, but shows a pair of large supratemporal fossae, bordered below by
  the zygoma, which is formed mainly by the squamoso-jugal bridge, and is shut off from the orbit by
  the postfrontal joining the bridge. The teeth are differentiated into incisors, canines, and
  molars (Fig. 54, C, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page280">280</a></span>). The lower canines
  close in front of the upper.</p>

  <p><i>Cynognathus</i>, Karroo formation of South Africa. <i>C. crateronotus</i> has a skull about
  16 inches long, looking like that of a ferocious Carnivore; there are four incisors, huge canines,
  and nine molars, the latter with serrated edges and anterior and posterior cusps. The wide
  supratemporal fossa is bordered and closed behind by the broad lateral extension of the parietal,
  which joins a similar extension of the squamosal bone. The latter is very long, extending to the
  postfrontal and to a bone which, bordering the orbit posteriorly, is either an upward branch of
  the jugal, or a postorbital bone; the latter interpretation is made probable by the occurrence of
  a suture with the jugal in <i>C. platyceps</i>. The jugal bone is very long, beginning at the
  quadrate, running along the squamosal, and forming the lower border of the orbit.</p>

  <p>The number of vertebrae is large, there being as many as twenty-nine presacrals, six of which
  belong to the cervical region. <span class="pagenum" id="page307"><span
  class="smaller">{307}</span></span>The atlas is fused with the axis; most of the thoracic ribs
  articulate partly upon the intercentra. The lumbar ribs are very peculiar; they are much expanded
  horizontally, and overlap each other, forming thereby intercostal foramina. The broad ilium is
  attached to three or four sacral ribs. The acetabulum is closed. The ventral side of the pelvis
  shows a broad symphysis and has a pair of obturator-foramina. The scapula is large, directed
  backwards, and shows a distinct, very Mammalian spine; it is fused with the coracoid and
  precoracoid.</p>

  <p>The occipital condyle of <i>C. platyceps</i> is kidney-shaped, with the concavity directed
  upwards; in <i>C. berryi</i> it is separated into two distinct knobs, the middle, basioccipital
  portion being apparently wanting. The mandible possesses a long coronoid process which ascends
  obliquely into the temporal fossa.</p>

  <p><i>Aelurosaurus</i>, <i>Lycosaurus</i>, <i>Galesaurus</i>, and many others, likewise of the
  Karroo formation. In the first genus the splenial bones help to form the symphysis of the lower
  jaw; teeth are also found on the palate, in opposition to <i>Lycosaurus</i>. This has a skull 6
  inches in length; the dental formula on either side is <i>i.</i> 4/3, <i>c.</i> 1/1, <i>m.</i>
  5/5; the molars are slender, conical, and recurved. <i>Galesaurus</i> seems to have been rather
  small, the low, triangular skull measuring only 2 to 3 inches in length, with four or five sharply
  pointed incisors, prominent canines and four or five small multicuspid or deeply serrated little
  molars.</p>

  <p><i>Endothiodon</i>, with several species from the Karroo formation, is of uncertain systematic
  position, only imperfect skulls being known. The animals must have been large and bulky, the
  skulls being very massive and at least one foot in length. The premaxillaries and the maxillaries
  are toothless, their alveolar borders forming cutting, prominent edges. The same applies to the
  very strong lower jaw; but there is a pair of tooth-like stout projections in the upper and lower
  jaws in the place of canine teeth. True, enamelled, small, apparently conical or low and perhaps
  blunt teeth occur on either side in one or three longitudinal series upon the palate, and in
  corresponding positions on the inner sides of the two halves of the lower jaw. It is doubtful if
  the upper teeth are carried by the palatines or by the broadened inner flanges of the maxillaries.
  The choanae seem to lie between the pterygoids and the palatines, incompletely roofed in by
  ventral extensions of the latter towards the middle line.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page308"><span class="smaller">{308}</span></span></div>

  <p>Direct affinity of <i>Endothiodon</i> (<span title="endothi"
  class="fsn">&#x1F10;&nu;&delta;&omicron;&theta;&#x03AF;</span>, within) with <i>Placodus</i> is
  unlikely; the same applies to the Dicynodontia, although the restriction of the teeth to the
  palate seems to point as much to the former genus as do the toothless cutting edges of the jaws to
  the forms like <i>Oudenodon</i>.</p>

  <p>Other Theriodont reptiles have been described from the upper Permian of Russia, for instance
  <i>Deuterosaurus</i> and <i>Brithopus</i>, but the determination rests upon insufficient
  fragments. North America has yielded many strange Theromorphous fossils, some of which may belong
  to the Theriodont order, while others seem to be intermediate between this and the other orders.
  <i>Diadectes</i> of Texas, for instance, seems to be a Theriodont creature; while in <i>Empedias
  molaris</i>, with a skull about 8 inches in length, the teeth form an uninterrupted series without
  distinct canine tusks, and the incisors are distinguished from the molars only by the transversely
  broadened shape of the latter. Very small teeth are arranged along the median line of the vomer
  and united palatine bones. In <i>Clepsydrops</i>, <i>Dimetrodon</i>, and <i>Naosaurus</i> of Texas
  the teeth are differentiated into incisors, canines, and molars, although not so regularly as in
  the typical Theriodont forms described above, one or more pairs of teeth being enlarged into
  canine-like tusks. In the latter two genera the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae are
  enormously elongated, standing up vertically to a height of 2 feet, while the centra of the
  vertebrae measure only one inch in diameter. In <i>Naosaurus claviger</i> these upright spines
  carry on either side half a dozen transverse projections. <i>Stereorhachis</i> of the Permian of
  France is typically Theriodont in the structure of its shoulder-girdle, humerus, and pelvis, but
  the dentition is composed of 3/3 incisors, no canines, and 6/10 pointed molars.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The following genera have been placed by Seeley in the family Gomphognathidae.
  <i>Microgomphodon</i>, with broader and less prominently multicuspid teeth than those of the
  typical Theriodonts, seems to lead to <i>Gomphognathus</i>, which has the following dentition:
  <i>i.</i> 3/3, <i>c.</i> 1/1, <i>m.</i> 12/12, with a long diastema between the canines and
  molars, some of which latter are nearly as broad as they are long, and have comparatively low
  tubercles on the crowns. The skull is remarkably like that of a Carnivorous Mammal. There are
  incisive foramina behind the premaxilla. The maxillaries and palatines form a united palatal roof,
  and behind them open the <span class="pagenum" id="page309"><span
  class="smaller">{309}</span></span>choanae. The occipital condyle is kidney-shaped. The mandible
  is most extraordinary, approaching that of the Mammalian, especially the Marsupial type, except
  that it is still composed of several pieces. The articular facet for the mandible is borne by an
  outward or lateral projection, while the bulk of the posterior half of the jaw projects inwards
  like a broad flange, undoubtedly recalling the so-called inner inverted angle of the Marsupial
  jaw. The coronoid process is large and extends far into the temporal fossa. Nearly the whole
  skeleton of <i>Microgomphodon</i> is known; the lumbar ribs are broadened and overlap as in
  <i>Cynognathus</i>, and the mandible is typically compound, so that there is no doubt about the
  affinities of this genus with the Theriodontia. It throws light upon <i>Gomphognathus</i> and the
  three likewise South African genera <i>Diademodon</i>, <i>Trirachiodon</i> and <i>Tritylodon</i>,
  which are all known from imperfect skulls only. Their teeth are restricted to the jaws, the molars
  have flat, multitubercular crowns and bear an extraordinary resemblance to those of Mammals. Some
  of the molars of <i>Tritylodon</i> are said even to possess two roots, but this point, absolutely
  unique in Reptiles, but common in Mammals, is not certain. The few upper incisors of
  <i>Tritylodon</i> are rather large, chisel-shaped, and extend like those of the Rodent-type back
  into the maxillaries; canines are absent, leaving a diastema. <i>Trirachiodon</i> has prominent
  canines, the five upper molars are multitubercular, rather flat, and much broader transversely
  than in the longitudinal direction. Still, even these creatures, with skulls of the size of that
  of a small fox, possessed distinct prefrontal and postfrontal bones, and are, at least in this
  respect, typical Reptiles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. ANOMODONTIA.</b></p>

  <p>The cranium is not roofed in. The pedicle for the suspension of the lower jaw is much
  elongated, slants slightly forwards, and is composed of the long quadrate, which is laterally
  overgrown by the squamosal bone. The teeth are restricted to a pair of strong, tusk-like canines,
  or they are altogether absent. The margins of the upper and especially those of the lower jaw are
  trenchant, and were possibly furnished with a thick horny armature like those of tortoises.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page310"><span class="smaller">{310}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Dicynodon</i>, with many species from the Karroo formation of South Africa, reached
  formidable dimensions. The thick, curved skull is in size and outline not unlike that of a large
  lion, hence <i>D. leoniceps</i>, <i>D. tigriceps</i>, etc. The zygomatic arch is almost mammalian,
  except that the posterior boundary of the orbit is formed by a distinct postfrontal bone. The
  nostrils are lateral. The canine tusks (Fig. 54, E, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page280">280</a></span>) are very large. The choanae open behind the rhomboid vomer and
  between the separated palatine bones, which are posteriorly confluent with the medially united
  pterygoids. The latter send out flat extensions, along the lateral side of the palatines; these
  extensions reach the maxillaries and probably represent the ectopterygoids. The occipital condyle
  is distinctly triple, being equally composed of the basi- and latero-occipital bones.</p>

  <p>The three bones of the shoulder-girdle meet at the glenoid fossa; the scapula has the
  indication of a spine. The pelvis is stout, attached to four or five vertebrae, converting the
  latter into a very Mammalian-like sacrum, the position of which lies distinctly in front of the
  acetabulum. The latter is closed, composed by the three pelvic bones. The pubes and ischia are
  fused together, leaving only a very small obturator-foramen. The limbs are plantigrade and
  pentadactyle, very stout; the humerus and femur have enormous crests.</p>

  <p><i>Oudenodon</i>, of which several species have been described, is so much like
  <i>Dicynodon</i>, except for the complete absence of teeth, that it has been suggested that these
  skulls belong to females of this genus. This view is strengthened by the fact that tusk-like
  canines exist, or are absent in some of the species which have been described as
  <i>Cistecephalus</i>, a genus closely allied to <i>Dicynodon</i>. The latter, which, like
  <i>Oudenodon</i> and <i>Cistecephalus</i>, occurred in Africa, extended also into India, <i>D.
  orientalis</i> having been found in the Panchet formation of Bengal, of transitional age between
  the Permian and Triassic epochs. <i>Oudenodon rugosus</i>, on the other hand, has been described
  from the Ural.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Gordonia</i> and <i>Geikia</i>, of the New Red Sandstone of Elgin, are known
  from their skulls only, but these are so well preserved that there is no doubt about their close
  relationship to the typical South African Dicynodontia. The skull of <i>Gordonia</i> is about 7
  inches long and 4 inches high. The canines (Fig. 54, D, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page280">280</a></span>) are reduced to short, but thick, conical tusks. The most <span
  class="pagenum" id="page311"><span class="smaller">{311}</span></span>remarkable feature is the
  very elongated squamoso-jugal arch, which arises moreover from the dorsal end of the long
  squamoso-quadrate pedicle. The two wide and long temporal fossae are dorsally divided by narrow
  parietal crests. There is a distinct interparietal bone, and the usual interparietal foramen. The
  choanae are united and lie within the palatines, which themselves are united; the large lateral
  palatal foramina are otherwise enclosed by the pterygoids, quadrates, and laterally by the
  squamoso-jugal arch.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order IV. PLACODONTIA.</b></p>

  <p class="sp5">These are the latest and last members of the Theromorpha, unfortunately known from
  skulls only, from the Muschelkalk or Middle Trias of Germany and Russia. The skull of <i>Placodus
  gigas</i> is about one foot long, rather high and triangular owing to the lateral expansion of the
  temporal arches, which diverge posteriorly. The squamoso-jugal arch is very broad, and most of the
  posterior border of the orbit is formed by the large postorbital bone. The maxillary bone seems to
  extend back to beyond the level of the orbits. The choanae lie behind the premaxillaries. The
  palatines and pterygoids are fused in the middle line, forming a broad bony palate, which, owing
  to the broad, posteriorly extended wings of the pterygoids, much resembles that of the crocodiles.
  The teeth are very remarkable. There are two or three stout, conical, or chisel-like teeth in each
  premaxillary bone, and three to five broad and flat maxillary teeth; three pairs of huge, broad,
  and quite flat teeth are crowded together and fill up the whole vomerine and palatine portion of
  the palate. These crushing teeth indicate that <i>Placodus</i> probably lived upon hard-shelled
  molluscs, and this would be in conformity with its occurrence in the Muschelkalk, which is a
  strictly marine deposit and full of shells. Another closely allied genus is <i>Cyamodus</i>, one
  species of which is known from Russia. The teeth are fewer in number and not so large as those of
  <i>Placodus</i>.</p>

  <p>It is customary to distinguish the marine, paddle-limbed kinds as <i>Turtles</i>, the others as
  <i>Land-</i> and <i>Water-tortoises</i>.</p>

  <p>Tortoises occur already in the Trias. They reached their greatest development towards the end
  of the Mesozoic and in the earlier Tertiary periods. They are now comparatively reduced in the
  number of families and genera, although they are still represented by about 200 species. The
  sub-class as a whole is cosmopolitan, but does not occur in the colder regions.</p>

  <p>Their origin is quite unknown. Of recent groups only the Crocodilia and the Rhynchocephalia
  come into consideration. Combination of these groups with the Chelonia leads to some unknown forms
  whence also the Theromorpha have arisen. Palaeontology does not help us, all the leading, main
  groups of Chelonia having been in existence in the earlier Mesozoic ages, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page313"><span class="smaller">{313}</span></span>and Palaeozoic Chelonia are still unknown.
  We can, however, to a certain extent, reconstruct an ideal primordial Chelonian by assigning to it
  all the ancestral characters actually observed in recent and fossil kinds, and by reducing to
  simpler conditions those features which we know to be more or less exaggerated specialisations. It
  is reasonable to assume that originally each metamere, except those of the anterior half of the
  neck and the posterior half of the tail, carried a transverse series of dermal plates, covered
  with horny shields, while the trunk, according to the greater bulk of the body, increased in size,
  converging towards the root of the neck and tail. By concentration, reduction of the number, and
  increase in the size of some of the remaining plates and shields, the skull assumed its
  characteristic box-like shape, the neck and tail becoming at the same time free. Chelonia are
  without doubt descendants of terrestrial, or at least semi-aquatic reptiles, and the marine
  paddled forms subsequently developed from terrestrial kinds.</p>

  <p><b>Classification of Chelonia.</b>&ndash;After many vicissitudes it was recognised that the
  Chelonia cannot naturally be divided according to the modification of their feet. The <span
  class="sc">Trionychoidea</span> were clearly separated from the rest by Stannius in 1854. Cope, in
  1870, was the first to emphasise the important character of the mode in which the neck is either
  bent sidewards (<span class="sc">Pleurodira</span>) or withdrawn in an <span class="sans
  fwb">S</span>-shaped curve in a vertical plane (<span class="sc">Cryptodira</span>); and he also
  separated <i>Sphargis</i> as <span class="sc">Athecae</span> from all the other Chelonians, for
  which Dollo in 1886 proposed the term <span class="sc">Thecophora</span>. The division of the
  latter into recognisable families, based upon reliable, chiefly internal, skeletal, characters,
  has been effected by Boulenger;<a id="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> and his
  classification has been adopted in the present volume, after intercalation of the more important
  fossil forms. The relationships between these various families may perhaps be indicated as
  follows:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The <b>vertebrae</b> are, sometimes in the various regions of the same individual, amphi-,
  opistho- or pro-coelous, or even biconvex. Traces of the chorda remain longest in the middle of
  the centra. Intercentra occur regularly on the first two or three cervicals, and then again in the
  tail as paired or unpaired nodules, or as short chevrons. The latter occasionally fuse with the
  caudal end of their centra. Intercentral discs of fibrous cartilage occur regularly in the neck
  and tail. The ribs develop originally in the same transverse level with these discs, and
  frequently the anterior thoracic vertebrae retain this intercentral or intervertebral position
  throughout life. Farther back they often show a gradual change from the intercentral to a more
  central and ultimately <span class="pagenum" id="page315"><span
  class="smaller">{315}</span></span>remarkable to a purely neural attachment. In all the Chelonia
  the ribs are devoid of the tubercular portion.</p>

  <p>The cervical vertebrae have no ribs, except mere traces in the shape of small nodules. On the
  tail the ribs are often large, and, when fused with their neural supports, look like transverse
  processes; the whole arrangement exactly resembles that of Crocodilia. The first pair of thoracic
  ribs, those borne by the ninth vertebra, are peculiar. They arise from the anterior portion of the
  centrum, are much reduced, sometimes to mere threads of bone, and lean against the anterior rim of
  the second pair of ribs, in many cases without reaching the carapace. The next following ribs,
  those of the tenth to the sixteenth vertebra, are intimately involved in the formation of the
  first to seventh costal plates. The ribs of the two sacral vertebrae sometimes remain quite
  distinct throughout life, just touching the upper <span class="pagenum" id="page316"><span
  class="smaller">{316}</span></span>ends of the iliac bones; but since these find a much more
  effective support in the shell, the distal ends of the sacral vertebrae fuse with the eighth, or
  so-called last, pair of costal plates.</p>

  <p>The neural arch of the ninth vertebra rests upon its centrum; but the neural arches of the
  other trunk-vertebrae, although long, rest upon two centra; retaining, like the ribs, their
  original intercentral position; and in most cases the neuro-central sutures remain throughout
  life. The atlas and the last cervical vertebra deserve special attention. In many tortoises,
  <i>e.g.</i> <i>Trionyx</i>, <i>Clemmys</i>, <i>Testudo</i>, the three constituent parts of the
  atlas, namely, the neural arch, the centrum, and the intercentrum or first pair of united
  basiventralia, do not ankylose, but remain loosely connected; and the first centrum, instead of
  forming an odontoid process, remains movably attached to the second centrum, although it sometimes
  carries, and fuses with, the second intercentral piece. In other tortoises, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Platemys</i> and <i>Chelys</i>, however, all the parts of the atlas co-ossify and form a
  complete, solid vertebra which articulates by a concavo-convex joint with the centrum of the
  second vertebra. The normal number of cervical vertebrae is eight in all Chelonians. The first
  spinal nerve issues between occiput and atlas, all the others behind the neural arches of their
  vertebrae. The last, or eighth cervical, owing to the retractility of the neck, forms elaborate
  joints; its centre fits with a knob into a cup of the ninth, and its post-zygapophyses form broad,
  curved articulating concave facets for the reception of the anterior zygapophyses of the fixed
  ninth vertebra. In the Trionychidae the zygapophyses are most elaborate, and they alone articulate
  with the ninth vertebra, while the centra do not join, but remain, or rather become, separated by
  partial resorption. In the Chelonidae, in conformity with the non-retractile and short neck, all
  the cervical joints are much reduced.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <b>skull</b> (cf. Fig. 54, H, I, K, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page280">280</a></span>)
  agrees fundamentally with that of <i>Sphenodon</i> and of the <i>Crocodilia</i>, but it is
  characterised by several special features. There are no ectopterygoids or ossa transversa; no
  lacrymal bones, no interparietal or pineal foramen; the vomer is unpaired and the nasal bones are
  mostly absent, unless they are fused with the prefrontals. The premaxillae are very small. The
  single vomer forms a septum between the choanae; and these are, except in <i>Sphargis</i>,
  ventrally roofed over by wings sent out by the palatines. The latter form a continuous bony roof
  to the mouth with the pterygoids, and these diverge posteriorly, being connected suturally with
  the quadrates, lateral and basi-occipital bones, and with the unpaired basi-sphenoid, which
  appears between the basi-occipital and the diverging pterygoids, but is in most cases to a great
  extent overlapped by the latter. The occipital condyle is distinctly triple; the basi-occipital
  sometimes helps to border the foramen magnum. The supra-occipital sends out a long vertical blade,
  directed backwards and generally projecting far over the neck, for the attachment of the powerful
  cranio-cervical muscles. The quadrate is very peculiar. Firmly attached, and hemmed in on nearly
  all sides by the neighbouring bones, it stands nearly vertically and forms a broad articulating
  surface for the mandible. Its posterior side shows either a transverse, horizontal groove, in
  which lies the columella auris, or the groove is transformed into a more or less closed canal.
  Moreover, the hinder lateral margin of the quadrate forms most of the tympanic frame; its margins
  being curved backwards, leaving in the Cryptodira, however, a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page318"><span class="smaller">{318}</span></span>wide notch behind; in the Pleurodira this
  part of the quadrate is transformed into a trumpet, the wide rim of which, forming a complete
  ring, carries the tympanic membrane. The tympanic cavity thus formed often leads into a deep
  recess which extends beneath the squamosal towards the opisthotic and bears some resemblance to
  the intricate tympanic recesses which pervade that region of the Crocodilian skull.</p>

  <p>Dorsally the quadrate is broadly overlaid by the squamosal, which frequently forms an arch with
  the parietal. Anteriorly the quadrate is connected through a variably sized quadrato-jugal with
  the jugal; and this, by joining the maxilla and postfrontal, helps normally to form the posterior
  rim of the orbit. All the bones which border the temporal fossa vary much in extent in the
  different groups of Chelonia. The extremes are represented by <i>Cistudo</i> and <i>Geoemyda</i>,
  in which the bony infratemporal arch is absent, owing to the loss of the quadrato-jugal; and on
  the other hand by the Chelonidae and by <i>Sphargis</i>, in which the whole temporal region is
  covered over by an additional "false cranial" roof. This roof is produced chiefly by lateral
  wing-like expansions of the parietal and postfrontal bones, which meet the likewise much expanded
  jugal, quadrato-jugal, and squamosal bones. In the lower diagram of Fig. 63 (<i>Chelone mydas</i>)
  the squamosal has been removed, and the other bones have been reduced to their normal, or rather
  primitive condition, for comparison with the external view of the complete skull of the same
  animal. The lower diagram shows also the connexion of the pterygoid with a descending process of
  the parietal; this column, paired of course, usually contains a separate bone, the epipterygoid,
  the portion between <i>Ptg</i> and <i>Par</i>.</p>

  <p>The hyoidean apparatus is well developed, and sometimes assumes large dimensions, especially in
  <i>Chelys</i>. The two pairs of "horns" are the first and second branchial arches, whilst the
  hyoid arches are reduced to a pair of small, frequently only cartilaginous, nodules attached near
  the anterior corners of the basis linguae, which generally fuses with the os entoglossum in the
  tip of the tongue.</p>

  <p>The <b>pectoral arch</b> consists of a pair of long coracoids sloping obliquely backwards, the
  distal cartilages of which scarcely touch each other in the middle line, and the scapulae. The
  upper end of the scapula frequently touches the inside of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page319"><span class="smaller">{319}</span></span>first costal plate, protected by a
  cartilaginous pad. Near the glenoid cavity arises a long process (PC in Fig. 65), placed
  transversely and approaching its fellow. The distal end is connected with that of the coracoid by
  a fibro-cartilaginous band. The homology of this scapular process is not quite clear. The band
  just mentioned favours the idea that the process represents the precoracoid, but its being an
  outgrowth from the scapula suggests that it is merely the much enlarged acromion. It certainly
  does not represent the clavicle, which forms part of the plastron: and this is not in contact with
  the shoulder-girdle at all.</p>

  <p>The <b>pelvis</b> is strong. Ilium, pubis, and ischium meet at the acetabulum. The dorsal end
  of the ilium is generally broadened, and is attached to one or both sacral vertebrae, but it is
  also in contact with the superimposed last costal plate. This additional connexion often becomes
  predominant and the sacral vertebrae are partly or completely relieved of the iliac support,
  fusing in this case more or less with the costal plates. The pubes have strong lateral processes,
  directed obliquely forwards and downwards. The pubes and the ischia, which latter are much
  smaller, form broad symphyses, and these are connected with each other by a longitudinal
  cartilaginous band (<i>Chelone, Trionyx</i>); or the connecting bridge is broad and quite ossified
  (<i>Testudo</i>), forming in the latter case two roundish obturator-foramina. Cartilage frequently
  remains at the anterior end of <span class="pagenum" id="page320"><span
  class="smaller">{320}</span></span>the pubic symphysis, and a smaller, longer, and narrow piece of
  cartilage extends sometimes backwards from the ischiadic symphysis, as the so-called hypo-ischium.
  In the Pleurodira the ends of the ilia, and those of the lateral processes of the pubes, are much
  broadened and firmly ankylosed with the posterior costal plates and with the xiphiplastron
  respectively.</p>

  ten separate elements, including the pisiform. In <i>Testudo</i> the centrale is fused with the
  intermedium, and the first three distal carpals are also fused together. In the marine turtles the
  limbs are transformed into paddles, but all the bones retain their independence; the pisiform
  <span class="pagenum" id="page321"><span class="smaller">{321}</span></span>and the first
  metacarpal are enlarged and flattened, thereby giving additional width to the paddle. The tarsus
  remains less primitive; the centrale and the proximal elements have a tendency to fuse together,
  most completely in land-tortoises; the fifth distal carpal is enlarged, and stands out hook-like
  from the rest. The number of the phalanges of the fingers and toes varies slightly. It is
  noteworthy that none of the Chelonia possess more than three phalanges. The three middle fingers
  and toes have mostly three phalanges; the pollex and hallux have always two; the number of
  phalanges of the fifth finger varies from three to one, of the fifth toe from two to none. The
  greatest reduction occurs in <i>Testudo</i> and its allied genera of typical land-tortoises,
  <i>Homopus</i>, <i>Pyxis</i>, and <i>Cinixys</i>, the formula for the fingers being 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
  or 1, and 2, 2, 2, 2, 0 for the toes. In <i>Pelomedusa</i> all the fingers possess two phalanges

  <p>The <b>shell</b>, which is the most characteristic feature of the Chelonia, consists of the
  dorsal "carapace" and the ventral "plastron." Each is composed of a considerable number of bony
  plates which arise as ossifications of nearly the whole thickness of the cutis, only a thin layer
  of subcutaneous connective tissue remaining soft and lining the inside of the shell. We restrict
  ourselves to a description of the shell of the Thecophora, leaving the discussion of the peculiar
  shell of <i>Sphargis</i> to <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page336">336</a></span> f. Very young
  tortoises are still soft, and the plates which are beginning to ossify are not yet suturally
  united. The plastron (Figs. 66 and 67) consists of the paired epi-, hyo-, hypo-, and
  xiphi-plastral plates, and the unpaired endo-plastral plate.</p>

  <p>The latter is homologous with the interclavicle, the epi-plastra are homologous with the
  clavicles of other Reptiles, while the other pieces are genetically derived from, and are further
  modifications of, the so-called abdominal ribs of the Crocodilia and Prosauria, These plastral
  plates are never in direct contact with the shoulder-girdle or with any other parts of the
  internal skeleton. In the young of all tortoises, and in the adult of the Chelonidae and
  Trionychidae, the several plastral plates enclose large, irregularly-shaped fontanelles. These are
  more or less filled up in the other groups; and in the Testudinidae especially the whole plastron
  forms one continuous mass. The navel is situated between the hyo- and hypo-plastrals. Both these
  pairs are broader than the others, and are connected with the carapace by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page323"><span class="smaller">{323}</span></span>means of several marginals. The connecting
  region is called the bridge. In several tortoises, e.g. <i>Emys</i>, the connexion with the
  marginals is formed by ligaments only and remains movable. In others, transverse, more or less
  perfect hinges are formed across the plastron. A rather imperfect joint between the hypo- and
  xiphi-plastrals develops with age in <i>Testudo ibera</i>. In <i>Cistudo</i> and <i>Cyclemys</i> a
  very effective hinge lies below the hyo- and hypo-plastrals, just in front of the bridge; and the
  anterior and posterior lobes of the plastron can be closed against the inner rim of the box,
  fitting tightly in <i>Cistudo</i>. In <i>Pyxis</i> the front lobe only is movable.</p>

  <p>The carapace is composed of one median series, a right and left lateral series of costal
  plates, and a series of marginals which surround the whole. The median series consists of one
  large nuchal plate, normally eight neurals and one to three supracaudal plates. The characteristic
  feature of the neural plates is that they are firmly fused with the broadened neural spinous
  processes of the underlying vertebrae. The nuchal plate lies in front of the first thoracic or
  ninth vertebra; it overlies the last cervical vertebrae, with the eighth of which it is connected
  by ligament only; but the posterior corner of the plate often fuses with the spine of the ninth
  vertebra. In the Chelydridae, and still <span class="pagenum" id="page324"><span
  class="smaller">{324}</span></span>more in the Trionychidae, the nuchal sends out a pair of long
  rib-like processes, which either extend to below some of the neighbouring marginals, or their ends
  overlap those of the ribs of the second thoracic vertebra (e.g. <i>Trionyx</i>), or, lastly, they
  are in turn overlapped by the first costal plates (e.g. <i>Cyclanorbis</i>). Such rib-like
  processes are also present, well developed in the young, shorter in the adult, in the
  Dermatemydidae and Cinosternidae. It is possible that the nuchal plate represents the fused neural
  of the eighth and the costal plates of the ninth vertebrae. An indication of the compound nature
  of the nuchal may be found in the fact that two nuchals have been described in <i>Chelydropsis
  carinata</i>, a Miocene relation of <i>Chelydra</i>. Somewhat similar modifications have taken
  place in the post-sacral region. The one to three supracaudal plates are, namely, neurals which
  have lost their connexion with, or perhaps have never been fused with, the spinous processes of
  the movable tail-vertebrae. The number of neural plates is mostly eight, but there are sometimes
  individually nine or ten, the gradual suppression taking place first in the sacral region. When
  such a plate is suppressed the neighbouring costal plates usually close up and meet in the median
  line. In <i>Cistudo</i>, for instance, there are only seven normal neurals, the eighth pair of
  costals meet, and the original eighth neural is transformed into a supracaudal. In
  <i>Cinosternum</i> the sixth to eighth costals meet, separating the one supracaudal widely from
  the remaining five neurals. The meeting of the last pair of costals, with co-ordinate reduction of
  the neurals to seven, is almost universal in the Pleurodira; and this tendency is carried out to
  an extreme in the Brazilian <i>Platemys</i> and in the Australian <i>Chelodina</i> and its allies,
  in which all the costals meet in the middle line, and the neurals are completely suppressed. Every
  stage intermediate between complete neurals (<i>Sternothaerus</i>) and interrupted, vestigial, and
  vanished neurals, is still represented by some genus. This process takes place independently, both
  in America and in Australia, and is one of the most recently introduced modifications.</p>

  <p>The costal plates arise, like the neurals, independently in the cutis, but they soon come into
  contact with the underlying cartilage of the ribs, which are long enough to reach the marginals.
  The ribs flatten, become surrounded by the growing membrane-bone of the plates, and the cartilage
  of the ribs, <span class="pagenum" id="page325"><span class="smaller">{325}</span></span>instead
  of ossifying, undergoes a process of calcification. Ultimately this is more or less absorbed, its
  place is taken by the dermal bone, which forms so to speak a cast of the rib, preserving in many
  cases the shape of the vanished rib, only the capitular portions of which remain unaffected. The
  number of costal plates is very constant, namely eight on each side, but some fossils have nine or
  ten, and there are still individual variations in recent forms, indicative of that number. In a
  large <i>Chrysemys concinna</i> I find the last pair of costals clearly composed of at least two
  pairs, and this same specimen has nine distinct neural plates.</p>

  <p>The marginal plates are originally paired, almost always eleven pairs, very rarely ten or
  twelve; an unpaired posterior plate, the pygal, is always present, and is probably the result of
  fusion. In the Chelonidae large fenestrae remain between the costal and marginal plates, only
  covered by leathery unossified cutis, and of course by the horny shields. In the Indian
  fresh-water genus <i>Batagur</i> similar windows are gradually filled up with age, and the horny
  shields become extremely thin and almost confluent. On the other hand, in <i>Testudo
  polyphemus</i>, the bony shell, always very thin, becomes still thinner with age and finally
  fenestrated by absorption.</p>

  <p>Great reduction has taken place in the carapace of the Trionychidae. The American species of
  <i>Trionyx</i> have only seven pairs of costal plates; in <i>Cyclanorbis</i> the neurals are
  reduced to two. The whole dorsal shell is much smaller than the body, and marginal plates are
  absent or merely vestigial. It is doubtful if the ossifications in the posterior half of the
  marginal flap of some genera are homologous with true marginals.</p>

  <p>Externally the whole shell is covered, except in the <i>Trionychidae</i>, in <i>Sphargis</i>
  and <i>Carettochelys</i> with horny, epidermal shields. These are phylogenetically older than the
  dermal plates, and they do not correspond with them either in numbers or in position, although
  there exists a general resemblance in their arrangement. On the plastron we distinguish an
  unpaired or paired gular, and a pair of gular, humeral, pectoral, abdominal, femoral, and anal
  shields (Fig. 66). Sometimes there are also intergulars, paired in <i>Macroclemmys</i> and
  <i>Chelys</i>, unpaired in <i>Chelone</i>; in many of the Pleurodira an unpaired intergular lies
  behind the gulars.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page326"><span class="smaller">{326}</span></span></div>

  <p>The carapace of most Chelonians is covered with five neural, four pairs of costal and twelve
  pairs of marginal <i>shields</i>, the last of which often forms an unpaired pygal. In front of the
  first neural lies the nuchal shield, very variable in size, often absent. The Chelydridae,
  Dermatemydidae, Platysternidae, and Cinosternidae possess moreover several inframarginals,
  intercalated on the bridge between the marginal and some of the plastral shields. In many of the
  other families these inframarginals are restricted to the anterior and posterior corners of the
  bridge, as the so-called axillaries and inguinals, mostly small and variable. Lastly,
  <i>Macroclemmys</i> has several small supramarginals.</p>

  <p>There are consequently eleven longitudinal rows of shields in all; by elimination of the supra-
  and infra-marginals they are reduced to seven rows. It is absolutely certain that the number of
  transverse rows also was originally much greater than it is now. The mode of reduction of the
  number of the neural and costal shields has been studied in <i>Thalassochelys caretta</i> (cf.
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page388">388</a></span>.) The accompanying illustration (Fig. 69)
  shows some of the main stages actually observed in the reduction of these shields. The chief point
  is that certain shields are squeezed out, or suppressed by their enlarging neighbours. The
  ultimate result is the formation of fewer, but larger shields.</p>

  <p>Each shield grows individually as follows. Every year, or rather during every periodically
  recurring period of growth, the area of the Malpighian layer belonging to each shield increases
  peripherally in size, and at the same time produces a new layer of horn. The original little
  shield, with which the tortoise is born, remains for years, often throughout life, as the
  so-called "areola;" it increases in thickness owing to the new layer of horn added from below, and
  peripherally the increase in size is indicated by the overlapping concentric rings. Each ring
  represents a year's growth, at least in tortoises which live in temperate zones, where hibernation
  means a complete suspension of growth. It is not known if the same applies to tropical species,
  which grow either throughout the year, or which undergo one or more periods of rest. The areola
  does not remain central; the growth is uneven. With age the oldest layers of the areola are
  frequently rubbed off, and the areola then appears enlarged.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 69.</span>&ndash;Diagrams illustrating the progressive
      reduction of the horny shields in various Chelonians. The shields, the fate of which it is
      desired to follow, are indicated by distinctive shading. I. Hypothetical, primitive stage.
      Eight neural (including the nuchal) and eight costal shields. Both neurals and costals lie in
      the same transverse planes. II.-VII. Successive stages in the reduction and suppression of
      various shields, observed in specimens of <i>Thalassochelys</i>, the normal condition of which
      is represented by VII. VIII. Six neurals and only four costals. The normal condition of
      <i>Chelone</i>. IX. The nuchal shield has become very small and the resulting gap has been
      filled up by an enlargement of the first pair of marginals. This is the normal condition of
      most Cryptodirous tortoises. X. The first marginals meet in front and the nuchal is either
      suppressed (X<i>a</i>[X<sup>a</sup> in diag]), <i>e.g.</i> in several species of
      <i>Testudo</i>, or it is surrounded by the marginals (X<i>b</i>), <i>e.g.</i> in
      <i>Sternothaerus</i>. (From Willey's <i>Zool. Results</i>, 1899.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page328"><span class="smaller">{328}</span></span></div>

  <p>For the first dozen years or so the annual rings can be easily followed, but when the creature
  approaches maturity each shield adds very little to its growth, and the rings become very fine,
  crowded and irregular. Only by careful counting and comparison of the rings on the costals,
  marginals, and plastrals, can a reliable average be arrived at. In some tortoises, e.g.
  <i>Chrysemys</i>, the whole outer layer of the shields peels off periodically; only a thin smooth
  layer like mica or tracing-paper remains, of course without any indication of rings. The pigment
  is formed in the Malpighian layer, but it frequently diffuses into the horny shields themselves,
  notably in <i>Chelone imbricata</i>, which yields the beautiful "tortoise-shell." The colour of
  the pigment is either black, yellow, or red, with resulting combinations. The green colour, often
  so beautiful in baby-specimens of <i>Chrysemys</i>, is optical, produced, according to Agassiz, by
  a network of black pigment, spread over a layer of yellow oil.</p>

  <p>Horny scales, sometimes forming spines, and covering a nodule of dermal ossification, are also
  common on other parts of the skin, especially on the limbs of land-tortoises, and also on the tail
  of <i>Chelydra</i>. Sometimes the end of the tail is protected by a claw-like nail, for instance
  in <i>Pyxis</i>. In some of the gigantic land-tortoises, and in <i>Chelone mydas</i>, this nail
  assumes large dimensions, and several of the terminal caudal vertebrae are fused together into a
  regular urostyle. In some subfossil specimens of Mauritian tortoises, these ankylosed complexes
  are 12 cm. long and more than 5 cm. broad!</p>

  <p>Before leaving the description of the shell, it is worth while to draw attention to the
  enormous correlative changes in other organs produced by this case. Nearly the whole organism has
  been altered. The hard, firm carapace has partly rendered the supporting functions of the
  vertebral column unnecessary or impossible. In many tortoises, especially in the large
  land-tortoises, the vertebrae and the capitular portions of the ribs are reduced to mere bony
  outlines; the reduction to thin paper-like bony lamellae proceeds with age. The iliac bones find a
  better support in the costal plates; the contact with the sacral ribs is given up, and these ribs
  fuse partly with the costal plates, or they are absorbed. The whole mass of muscles of the trunk
  is completely lost in the region of the shell, but traces of them exist in young specimens. Neck,
  limbs, and tail can in most cases be withdrawn and hidden in the shell. When this is not possible
  it is due to secondary changes. The neck is withdrawn either by being tucked away <span
  class="pagenum" id="page329"><span class="smaller">{329}</span></span>sideways (Pleurodira<a
  id="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>), or by being bent in an <span class="sans
  fwb">S</span>-shaped curve in a vertical plane. In a left-sided profile-view of the animal, the
  head represents the tail of the <span class="sans fwb">S</span>. The neck is withdrawn by long
  muscles, which are inserted into the ventral side of the middle of the neck, and extend in the
  shape of vertical ribbons far back into the shell, arising from the centra of some of the middle
  or even more posterior thoracic vertebrae.</p>

  <p>Lastly, a few remarks on the <b>partial regeneration</b>, or the mending of injuries to the
  shell. If part of the horny covering is badly bruised, torn off, or rubbed through, or if part of
  the shell is crushed, the underlying portion of the bony plate becomes necrotic, and the horny
  covering also dies so far as its Malpighian layer is destroyed. Soon, however, the uninjured
  Malpighian cells, around the margin of the wound, multiply, grow into and beneath the injured
  portion of the bone, and form a new horny layer, casting off the necrotic portion. After several
  months the deficiency is patched up; new bone has grown in the deeper remaining strata of the
  cutis, and the outside is covered by a continuous horny layer, without, however, reproducing the
  original concentric moulding of the shields. In badly crushed shells sometimes almost one-third of
  the whole shell is thus cast off and mended within one or two years. The regeneration of the
  forcibly stripped-off shields of <i>Chelone imbricata</i> is described on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page386">386</a></span>. Bitten-off tails and limbs, rather frequent occurrences in
  water-tortoises, are of course not reproduced, but the wounds are healed and covered again with
  scaly skin.</p>

  <p><b>Sense-organs.</b>&ndash;The <span class="smaller">EYE</span> is by far the best developed
  sense-organ. It is comparatively small. The pupil is round. The iris is mostly dark in terrestrial
  forms, while in water-tortoises it is often brightly coloured, for instance pale yellow in
  <i>Chelodina</i>, greenish and mottled with black, pale grey, brown, etc., in various species of
  <i>Chrysemys</i>. <i>Cistudo</i> presents a curious sexual dimorphism; the males have red, the
  females brown, eyes. The sclerotic wall contains a ring of numerous small ossified plates. There
  is no trace of a pecten. The eye is protected externally by the two lids and the nictitating
  membrane. In some water-tortoises, notably in <i>Chelodina</i>, the lower lid is transparent.
  Lacrymal and Harderian glands are present.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page330"><span class="smaller">{330}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <span class="smaller">SENSE OF HEARING</span> is apparently not very acute, although
  tortoises and turtles are frightened by noise, and can distinguish sounds; otherwise they would
  have no voice, which is very tiny and piping in most tortoises during the pairing season. In most
  water-tortoises the tympanic membrane is thin and quite exposed; in land-tortoises it is often
  thick and covered by the ordinary skin; lastly, in <i>Chelone</i> the tympanic cavity is filled
  with a plug of the much-thickened skin, possibly in adaptation to the water-pressure when these
  creatures dive to considerable depths. The ossicular chain is mostly reduced to a long, bony,
  columellar rod.</p>

  <p>The <span class="smaller">SENSE OF SMELL</span> is well developed. All Chelonians carefully
  smell their food, in the air as well as under water. The individual predilection shown by many
  species for different kinds of animal and vegetable food,&ndash;since they are, for instance, able
  to distinguish between the various sorts of cabbage, cauliflower, sprouts, etc.,&ndash;proves that
  they possess a considerable amount of smell and taste.</p>

  <p>Tortoises have a fine sense of touch; even the slightest tap on the shell is noticed, and the
  skin of the soft parts is extremely sensitive. Tickling of the sides of the tail, or of the hinder
  surface of a thigh, produces ridiculous scratching actions of the same or of the opposite
  foot.</p>

  <p>The <b>digestive apparatus</b> is simple. Only a few peculiarities need be mentioned. The
  tongue is mostly broad and soft; it cannot be protruded. The oesophagus of the Chelonidae is
  covered with many conical projections pointing towards the stomach. The latter is simple, except
  in <i>Sphargis</i>. The intestine is devoid of a caecum, but the difference between the small
  intestine and the rectum is very marked and often abrupt. The cloaca is very roomy. It contains
  the large copulatory organ, which is unpaired, grooved on its dorsal side, and is altogether
  constructed like that of the Crocodilia. The large bladder opens ventrally into the urodaeum, a
  recess of the cloaca; near its base open the urinary and genital ducts. Many water-tortoises
  possess also a pair of lateral thin-walled sacs, the so-called anal sacs, dorso-lateral
  diverticula of the walls of the urodaeum. These sacs, which have highly vascularised walls, are
  incessantly filled and emptied with water through the vent, and act as important respiratory
  organs. When such a water-tortoise, for instance an <i>Emys</i> or a <i>Clemmys</i>, is suddenly
  taken out of the water, it squirts out a <span class="pagenum" id="page331"><span
  class="smaller">{331}</span></span>stream of this water, which is not, as is generally supposed,
  the urine from the bladder.</p>

  <p>The mode of <b>respiration</b> is interesting. The lungs are very complicated,
  highly-developed, spongy structures. They are attached by their whole dorsal surface to the inner
  lining of the shell. As they cannot expand through their own initiative, and since the shell has
  made costal and abdominal expansion impossible, the tortoise has to resort to other means of
  producing the necessary vacuum. This is done partly by the neck and the limbs, which act like
  pistons in being drawn in and out; partly by the greatly developed hyoidean apparatus, by which,
  when the neck is stretched out, the throat is alternately inflated and emptied, the air being
  swallowed, or pumped into the lungs. Additional respiration, besides that of the anal sacs
  mentioned above, is effected in various aquatic tortoises by slightly vascularised recesses of the
  pharyngeal region. Most Chelonians can exist for a very long time without breathing; sulky
  individuals remain for hours or days under water. <i>Cistudo</i> can shut itself up for an equally
  long time. Nevertheless this and other land-tortoises easily get drowned.</p>

  <p>All Chelonians lay white <b>eggs</b>, round or oval, according to their kind, but the shape of
  the eggs of one set sometimes varies within the greatest limits. The shell varies from a
  parchment-like, flexible, scarcely calcareous cover to a hard, well-polished case. As a rule the
  eggs, imbedded in the ground, are hatched after a few months, but in some of the northern kinds,
  e.g. <i>Emys orbicularis</i>, the hatching is deferred until the next spring, the embryo's
  development being arrested during the winter. How such eggs, buried a few inches only below the
  surface, withstand the often very severe North German and Russian winter is a mystery. Whilst the
  plastron is generally flat, it is more or less concave in the males of many species, notably in
  <i>Testudo</i>, <i>Cistudo</i>, and <i>Emys</i>.</p>

  <p>The general conclusions which can be drawn from the present <b>geographical distribution</b> of
  the Chelonia are as few and unsatisfactory as those applying to the Crocodilia, since all the main
  groups of Chelonians, and many more extinct families, occurred together in bygone ages in the same
  countries, for instance in Europe.</p>

  <p>The marine forms are naturally cosmopolitan, but the <i>Testudinidae</i> are likewise
  cosmopolitan, except in the Australian region. The <i>Chelydridae</i>, now restricted to North and
  Central America, occurred formerly also in Europe. The <i>Pleurodira</i>, in Mesozoic times
  plentiful in Europe, India, and North America, are now restricted to South America, Australia, and
  Africa; the <i>Pelomedusidae</i> to Africa, Madagascar, and South America; the <i>Chelydidae</i>
  to South America and Australia. In the latter country all the Chelonians belong to the Chelydidae.
  The <i>Trionychoidea</i>, occurring since the Cretaceous epoch in North America, in Early and
  Mid-Tertiary times in Europe, are now restricted to North America, Asia, and Africa. The country
  richest in Chelonians is America; North and Central America together possessing representatives of
  all the families except the Pleurodira, and these we know to have died out there. The
  <i>Dermatemydidae</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page333"><span

  Nearctic sub-region (including Central America). Poorest in genera and species, all of them
  Chelydidae, is the Australian region, where no fossils of other families have yet been discovered.
  Europe, with its few Testudinidae, does not come into consideration; Asia has at least
  Testudinidae and Trionychidae, and in addition the solitary <i>Platysternum</i> in Indo-China,

  <p><b>Fam. Sphargidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Sphargis</i> s. <i>Dermatochelys coriacea</i>, the Leathery
  Turtle or Luth, is the only recent species and is the largest of all recent Chelonians. The
  biggest specimen in the national collection is about six feet and a half long, from the nose to
  the end of the shell, which latter is about four feet long; such a specimen may weigh half a ton.
  Agassiz, however, says that he has seen some "weighing over a ton." The general colour is dark
  brown, either uniform or with yellow spots. The Leathery Turtle has a wide distribution, ranging
  over all the intertropical seas, but it is rare everywhere; least so perhaps in the Western
  Atlantic from Florida to Brazil and in the Indian Ocean.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>According to Agassiz it breeds regularly every year in the spring on the Bahamas, on the
  Tortugas, and on the coast of Brazil, depositing its many eggs on the sandy shore like other
  turtles. Accidentally it visits the northern coast up to Long Island, and specimens, perhaps
  carried with the Gulf Stream, have been caught on the coasts of Europe, for instance off
  Dorsetshire. One was caught near Nantes in 1729, and is said to have made a terrible noise when
  being killed. This is perhaps the reason why Merrem in 1820 invented the generic name
  <i>Sphargis</i>, supposed to be derived from <span title="spharage&ocirc;"
  class="fsn">&sigma;&phi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&#x03AD;&omega;</span> (I make a noise). It has
  also been recorded from the Mediterranean. It seems to be entirely carnivorous, living upon
  Molluscs, Crustacea, and fish. The flesh is supposed to be unwholesome. It is a very curious fact
  that of this rare species only large specimens, besides a very few baby-turtles, are known or
  preserved in collections, while individuals of intermediate size, say from four inches to three
  feet in length, have never been recorded. If it were not for the fact that they are still known to
  breed, it would look as if the <span class="pagenum" id="page335"><span
  class="smaller">{335}</span></span>species were dying out. Perhaps they are very shy, leading a
  pelagic life, diving at the least sign of danger, and coming near the land only for the sake of
  breeding.</p>

  <p>The structure of <i>Sphargis</i> is so peculiar in many respects that it deserves a somewhat
  full account. The neuro-central sutures persist on all the vertebrae. The eight cervicals are
  short. All the ten trunk-vertebrae carry ribs, and these, with the exception of the last,
  articulate between the centra and with the neural arches; the first and tenth ribs are short, the
  others are long and flattened, but not broad, with wide spaces between them. The tail is short,
  although it consists of about twenty vertebrae; these are devoid of chevrons.</p>

  <p>The skull superficially resembles that of <i>Chelone</i>, chiefly owing to the completely
  roofed-in temporal region. The supraoccipital crest is rather short, covered completely by the
  parietals, the posterior margin of which is rounded off instead of forming, as in the Chelonidae,
  a long projecting triangular crest with the supra-occipital. The parietals are in broad contact
  with the postfrontals, posteriorly they are just reached by the squamosals. The quadrato-jugal is
  small, separated from the postfrontal by the meeting of the squamosal with the jugal. The quadrate
  is notched behind, and it separates the opisthotic from the squamosal. The basisphenoid is large
  and broad, extending far forwards so as to separate the pterygoids widely from each other except
  in their anterior portions, which, instead of sending a lateral arm to the jugal and maxillary, as
  in <i>Chelone</i>, are widely separated from these bones by the palatines. The choanae lie on
  either side of the anterior half of the vomer, and are not roofed over by ventral vomero-palatine
  wings.</p>

  <p>The limbs and their girdles are essentially like those of the Chelonidae, but are not derivable
  from them. The most remarkable feature is the shell. The dorsal and ventral halves are directly
  continuous, forming one unbroken case all round, which is composed of many hundreds of little bony
  plates, irregularly polygonal, fitting closely into each other with their sutural edges, and
  giving the shell a beautiful mosaic appearance. On the dorsal side are a median row and three
  pairs of lateral rows of larger plates, and these form seven longitudinal blunt ridges which all
  converge towards the triangularly pointed tail-end of the shell. The ridges are not so much
  produced by thickened <span class="pagenum" id="page336"><span
  class="smaller">{336}</span></span>or spine-like edges of the plates, but by the right and left
  halves of the plates being actually bent at an angle. This is most conspicuous at the sides of the
  shell where it passes into the ventral portion. The latter has two pairs of lateral and one median
  ridge. The whole shell has consequently twelve ridges. The mosaic plates are deeply imbedded in
  the cutis, being externally as well as internally covered or lined with dense leathery skin. The
  epiderm is thin, and shows no indications of horny scales. In young specimens the whole shell is
  soft and very imperfectly ossified, later on it is quite rigid, although comparatively thin. It is
  nowhere in contact with the internal skeleton, except by a nuchal bone, which by a descending
  process articulates with the neural arch of the eighth cervical vertebra.</p>

  <p>The affinities of the Sphargidae and their position in the system are still debatable. Whilst
  some authorities, <i>e.g.</i> Cope, Dollo, and Boulenger look upon <i>Sphargis</i> as the sole
  remnant of a primitive group in opposition to all the other recent Chelonia, Baur considered it
  the most specialised descendant of the Chelonidae. Dames agreed with him. Van Bemmelen has
  modified this view in so far as he regards <i>Sphargis</i> as the most specialised Chelonian, but
  considers the differences between it and the Chelonidae great enough to conclude that both
  Sphargidae and Chelonidae represent two independent, partly parallel, branches which have arisen
  from two different groups of terrestrial tortoises. Case,<a id="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> from the study of <i>Protostega</i> and other fossil forms,
  tends towards Baur's view. He believes that <i>Sphargis</i> is the culminating form of a branch
  which through <i>Psephophorus</i> and with <i>Eosphargis</i> has sprung from some creature like
  <i>Lytoloma</i>, which at the same time is the starting-point of another branch which culminates
  in the genera <i>Thalassochelys</i> and <i>Chelone</i>, while lastly a third branch contains
  <i>Protostega</i>, <i>Protosphargis</i>, and <i>Pseudosphargis</i>. In other words, he considers
  them all Chelonidae. If he is right we have of course no business to separate <i>Sphargis</i> with
  its fossil allies from the rest of the Chelonia as "Athecae."</p>

  <p>However, Case has not proved his point. It is easy enough to understand that the characters of
  the cranium and plastron of <i>Sphargis</i> are in a condition which by partial reduction can be
  derived from that of typical Chelonidae. The structure of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page337"><span class="smaller">{337}</span></span>cervical vertebrae, the absence of the
  marginal plates and the peculiar articulation of the nuchal with the last cervical vertebra can be
  explained as convergent analogies, just like the paddles of <i>Carettochelys</i>. But the shell of
  <i>Sphargis</i> is fundamentally different from and not homologous with that of the others. Cope
  was therefore quite justified in distinguishing the Sphargidae as "Athecae" in opposition to the
  others which Dollo later on, by contrast, named "Thecophora." Unfortunate names, since both groups
  are undeniably in possession of a <span title="th&ecirc;k&ecirc;"
  class="fsn">&theta;&#x03AE;&kappa;&eta;</span> or shell. Both authors meant, however, by Theca the
  epidermal shields, but even this distinction is rendered invalid by <i>Carettochelys</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The most reasonable explanation has been suggested by Hay.<a id="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> The mosaic polygonal components of the shell of
  <i>Sphargis</i> are, so to speak, an earlier generation of osteodermal plates than the later
  generation of longer and broader bony plates which in the Thecophora come into contact, and fuse
  with, the neural arches and ribs. The osteoderms of <i>Sphargis</i> belong to the same category as
  the dermal ossifications in the scutes of Crocodilia, whilst the plates of the carapace and
  plastron of the Thecophora belong to the category of the abdominal ribs. <i>Sphargis</i> has the
  first kind in its peculiar shell, the second kind in the deeper lying plastron and in its nuchal
  plate. But it has lost, or perhaps had never developed, the horny shields. The only difficulty is,
  however, the presence of a plastron and of a typical neural plate in <i>Sphargis</i>. This
  difficulty is not very serious. The plastron is a very old institution. It occurs together with
  the more superficial osteoderms in <i>Caiman</i>, and the nuchal plate may be the oldest of all
  dorsals. We can scarcely imagine that the direct ancestors of <i>Sphargis</i> had developed both
  kinds of shells, and that comparatively recently the inner shell of the carapace was lost, leaving
  only the nuchal plate. Fossils do not support such an assumption. Undoubted ancestral forms of
  <i>Sphargis</i> are very rare. <i>Psephophorus</i> of the Oligocene and Miocene of Europe had a
  continuous mosaic shell much resembling that of <i>Sphargis</i>; <i>Eosphargis</i> is represented
  by a well-preserved skull from the London clay. Then follows a wide gap until we come to
  <i>Psephoderma</i> of the Rhaetic, or Upper Trias of Bavaria; the large fragment of whose dorsal
  shell is composed of about 200 mosaic pieces. If this fragment really formed part of the shell
  <span class="pagenum" id="page338"><span class="smaller">{338}</span></span>of a Chelonian, its
  age would speak greatly in favour of the Athecae being a very primitive and independent group.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. THECOPHORA.</b></p>

  <p><i>Thoracic vertebrae and ribs united with a series of median or neural and a paired series of
  lateral or costal plates. Parietals prolonged downwards, meeting the pterygoids directly or by
  interposition of an epipterygoid.</i></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Cryptodira.</b>&ndash;<i>The carapace is covered with horny shields. The neck,
  if retractile, bends in an <span class="sans fwb">S</span>-shaped curve in a vertical plane. The
  pelvis is not fused with the shell.</i></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Chelydridae.</b>&ndash;The plastron is small and cross-shaped (Fig. 61, <span
  class="smaller">2</span>, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page315">315</a></span>); the bridge is
  very narrow, and the displaced abdominal shields are widely separated from the marginals by a few
  irregularly shaped inframarginals. The tail is long. The limbs, neck, and head are so stout that
  they cannot be completely withdrawn into the shell. Snout with a powerful hooked beak. American;
  only two genera, each with one species.</p>

  <p>The temporal region is roofed very incompletely and only anteriorly by the expanded parietals
  and postfrontals, which form a long suture. The plastron consists of nine bony plates, a small
  entoplastron being present; there are lacunae in the middle line, the plates meeting imperfectly,
  and the horny abdominal shields are likewise separated by soft skin. The carapace has a nuchal
  with long rib-like processes which underlie the marginals; the neural plates form a continuous
  series. There are twenty-three marginal plates. The pubic and ischiadic symphyses remain separate,
  enclosing one large heart-shaped foramen. The five fingers and toes are webbed and are protected
  by claws except the outer toe, the nail of which is usually suppressed.</p>

  <p><i>Chelydra serpentina</i>, the Snapping Turtle, attains a large size, namely, a shell-length
  of more than one foot, and a total length from the nose to the tip of the tail of more than three
  feet. Its range extends from the Canadian lakes east of the Rocky Mountains, through the United
  States and Central America. The carapace of young specimens has three very marked series of keels,
  which gradually disappear with age, until in very old individuals the shell becomes quite smooth.
  The skin is very warty, especially on the neck, and there is a pair of minute <span
  class="pagenum" id="page339"><span class="smaller">{339}</span></span>barbels on the chin. The
  tail carries three series of originally triangular horny crests, which with age are transformed
  into blunt knobs. The general colour of this rather ugly creature is olive, mottled with dark
  brown above and with yellowish below.</p>

  <p>According to Holbrook the Snapping Turtle is found in stagnant pools, or in streams where the
  waters are of sluggish motion. Generally they prefer deep water, and live at the bottom of rivers;
  at times, however, they approach the surface, above which they elevate the tip of their pointed
  snout, all other parts being concealed; and in this way they float slowly with the current, but if
  disturbed they descend speedily to the bottom. They are extremely voracious, feeding on fish,
  reptiles, or any animal substance that falls in their way. They take the hook readily, whatever
  may be the bait, though most attracted by pieces of fish; in this way many are caught for the
  market. It is, however, necessary to have strong hooks and tackle, otherwise they would be broken,
  for the animal puts forth great strength in his struggles to escape, both with his firm jaws and
  by bringing his anterior extremities across the line. When caught they always give out an odour of
  musk, which in very old animals is sometimes disagreeably strong.</p>

  <p>Occasionally the Snapping Turtle leaves the water, and is seen on the banks of rivers or in
  meadows, even at a distance from its accustomed element. On land his motions are awkward; he walks
  slowly, with his head, neck, and long tail extended, elevating himself on his legs like the
  Alligator, which at that time he greatly resembles in his motions; like the Alligator also, after
  having walked a short distance, he falls down to rest for a few moments, and then proceeds on his
  journey. In captivity they prefer dark places, and are exceedingly ferocious; they will seize upon
  and bite severely anything that is offered them, and their grasp upon the object with their strong
  jaws is most tenacious.</p>

  <p>The Snapping Turtles, or "Snappers," are feared on account of the ferocious bites which they
  inflict, and they are hated because of the destruction of valuable fish and water-fowl. They in
  turn atone for this damage by being eaten, especially the younger half-grown individuals, the
  flesh of the older ones being too much tainted with the odour of musk. The round eggs, which are
  laid to the number of twenty to thirty in the summer <span class="pagenum" id="page340"><span
  class="smaller">{340}</span></span>(in the Northern States about June), are likewise good to eat.
  The first act of the young creature on leaving the shell is said to be snapping and biting. In
  captivity they are often very sulky, and refuse food stubbornly for many months, perhaps for a
  whole year, and apparently without much harm to themselves, since they lie quietly in the distant
  corner of the tank, now and then slowly rising to the surface to breathe. Fresh-water algae grow
  on the shell and in the mud which settles on it, and since this happens also in the wild state,
  they are rendered as inconspicuous as old rotten logs. In order to attract fishes they protrude a
  pair of worm-like, pale pink filaments from the tip of the tongue.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Macroclemmys temmincki</i>, the "Alligator Turtle."&ndash;In size and general appearance
  much like the other Snapping Turtle, but the dorsal shields have each a strong and prominent keel,
  and these three series increase in size with age. The costal shields are separated from the
  marginals by an additional series of about four supramarginals, well shown in the illustration.
  The shields of <span class="pagenum" id="page341"><span class="smaller">{341}</span></span>the
  cross-shaped plastron are subject to much individual variation, small shields being frequently
  intercalated, or rather retained, between the usual ones, especially between the pectorals and
  abdominals, in the gular region, and on the narrow bridge, where the inframarginals number one to
  three or even more. This species inhabits, broadly speaking, the whole basin of the Mississippi
  and Missouri rivers.</p>

  <p>This beast is as vicious as the other Snapping Turtle. According to Agassiz it does not
  withdraw its head and limbs on the approach of danger, but resorts to more active defence. It
  raises itself upon the legs and tail, highest behind, opens the mouth widely, and throwing out the
  head quickly as far as the long neck will allow, snaps the jaws forcibly upon the assailant, at
  the same time throwing the body forward so powerfully as often to come down to the ground when it
  has missed its object.</p>

  <p>It lives mostly in the water, but makes considerable journeys overland. Both in the water and
  on dry land the limbs move nearly perpendicularly, and the body is raised high. On dry land a
  considerable part of the weight of the body is borne by the long, strong tail.</p>

  <p>"They are as ferocious as the wildest beast of prey, but the slowness of their motions, their
  inability to repeat the attack immediately, their awkwardness in attempting to recover their
  balance when they have missed their object, their haggard look, and the hideous appearance of
  their gaping mouth, constitute at such times a picture as ludicrous as it is fearful and
  revolting. Their strength is truly wonderful. I have seen a large specimen bite off a piece of a
  plank more than an inch thick. They take hold of a stick with such tenacity that they may be
  carried for a considerable distance suspended to it free above the ground. Fishes and young ducks
  are their ordinary prey. They lay from twenty to forty or more round eggs only about the size of a
  small walnut in holes which they dig in sloping banks not far from the water" (Agassiz).</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Dermatemydidae.</b>&ndash;The pectoral shields are widely separated from the
  marginals by inframarginals, the gular shields are very small or absent, and the tail is extremely
  short. Only two or three genera, with three or four species in Central America.</p>

  <p>The plastron is composed of nine plates. In <i>Dermatemys mawi</i> it is large, firmly joined
  to the carapace, covered with <span class="pagenum" id="page342"><span
  class="smaller">{342}</span></span>eleven or more shields, and there are four inframarginals; in
  <i>Staurotypus salvini</i> of Mexico the plastron is cruciform, with the anterior lobe movable,
  covered with seven or more shields, according to the fusion of the anal shields and the presence
  or absence of the gulars; there are only two inframarginals. The pubic and ischiadic symphyses
  remain separate; the temporal fossa remains widely open, the postfrontals scarcely touching the
  parietals. There are 23 marginal shields in <i>Staurotypus</i>, 25 in <i>Dermatemys</i>, including
  the unpaired nuchal. The nuchal plate has a pair of rib-like processes like those of the
  Chelydridae, but some of the posterior costal plates, sometimes only one pair, meet in the middle
  line, overlying or suppressing the corresponding neural plates. The shell of these aquatic
  tortoises is rather flat, more or less keeled, especially in young specimens, and in the fully
  adult condition is about one foot in length.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Cinosternidae</b>, represented by the single genus <i>Cinosternum</i>, with about
  ten species in North and Central America, and one in Guiana. Closely allied to the two previous
  families, with which it agrees by the separation of the pubic and ischiadic symphyses, the
  presence of an ento-plastral plate, the possession of inframarginal shields (Fig. 61, <span
  class="smaller">3</span>, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page315">315</a></span>), the widely open
  temporal fossae, and the rib-like pair of processes to the nuchal plate. It agrees with the
  Dermatemydidae in the interruption of the neural plates by the meeting of several pairs of the
  costal plates. There are 23 marginal shields; five or four shields, according to the presence or
  absence of the gular on the plastron, and in some species these plastral shields become, with age,
  more and more separated from each other by soft skin (see Fig. 75). The shape and size of the
  plastron differ considerably in the various species; in most of them, e.g. in <i>C.
  pennsylvanicum</i> and <i>C. leucostomum</i>, but not in <i>C. odoratum</i>, the anterior and
  posterior lobes are movable, with transverse soft hinges, so that the animal can completely close
  its shell. The skin of the legs and neck is so baggy and loose that these parts slip in, the skin
  rolling off, when the creature withdraws into its shell. They lay only a few&ndash;from three to
  five&ndash;elliptical eggs, which have a shining, glazed, and thick, but very brittle shell.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Cinosternum odoratum</i>, the Mud-Turtle, or Stinkpot Terrapin, so called on account of the
  disagreeable smell which exudes from the inguinal glands. The head is disproportionately large,
  with the snout rather compressed laterally, and pointed underneath, with several short barbels.
  The neck is long and slender. The carapace of the young is keeled, each of the neural shields
  being raised in the middle line; but in full-grown specimens the shell becomes quite smooth and
  rounded. The horny shields of the plastron are relatively largest in the young, but they soon
  leave ever-increasing spaces between them, which are then filled with soft skin only, which thinly
  covers the underlying bone. The <span class="pagenum" id="page344"><span
  class="smaller">{344}</span></span>fore- and hind-limbs, especially the latter, are extensively
  webbed, and are provided with five short claws. The general colour of the shell is horny brown,
  either uniform or with darker spots or streaks. The neck and limbs are mottled brown. The only
  ornamental colouring is a pair of clear yellow broad lines on each side of the head, and a similar
  streak on each side of the lower jaw. On the chin and upper throat are two pairs of small
  tentacles. The tail of the male is of about the length of the hind-limbs, while that of the female
  is so short that its tip scarcely reaches beyond the hinder margin of the carapace. Length of the
  shell of full-grown specimens between four and five inches. Very young specimens have a rather
  droll appearance, owing to the long and slender neck with the large head, and the humpy back.</p>

  <p>This species is common in the eastern half of North America, from Canada to Texas. It is mainly
  aquatic, and is one of the dullest and shyest species. My own specimens spend most of their time
  in the water, invariably in the darkest corners, preferably under a stone or a log, and they do
  not leave their hiding places until dark, in search of worms, meat, and all sorts of animal food.
  For months I could never induce them to take food from a stick, or even to eat in my presence, and
  it was not until after many weeks that one of them at last protruded its head far enough to
  exhibit the yellow stripes. When taken out of the water they draw in their heads, just allowing
  the vicious little eyes to be visible, and opening the sharp-edged mouth widely to bite
  deliberately and furiously at the unwary finger. Some spent the winter in the water, in the
  greenhouses, feeding as usual, others crept on land, hiding under moss, half buried in the soil,
  where they slept for several months, but with interruptions in order to soak and to drink. When
  spring is well advanced they prefer the water for their regular sojourn. Some which had been sent
  over from New York arrived in a deplorably dried-up condition, the skin being quite flabby and
  shrivelled, but after a few hours' soaking they came round, and increased considerably in weight,
  the limbs and neck becoming turgid.</p>

  <p><i>C. pennsylvanicum</i> of Eastern North America has a larger, more oval plastron. The head is
  not so strikingly large as in the other species and, like the neck, is brown with yellowish spots,
  and often has streaks on the sides. The tail of the male ends in a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page345"><span class="smaller">{345}</span></span>nail-like horny point. The lobes of the
  plastron are well hinged in the adult.</p>

  <p><i>C. leucostomum</i> of Central America is larger, with a shell-length of six inches. The
  plastron is not at all cruciform, but has a broad bridge, and fills the box, moreover it has an
  anterior and a posterior hinge, so that the box can be completely closed. Hence the vernacular
  name of the Box-Terrapin.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Platysternidae</b>, represented by the single species <i>Platysternum
  megacephalum</i> in Burma, Siam, and Southern China.</p>

  <p>The pectoral shields are widely separated from the marginals by inframarginals, the plastron is
  large, oblong, not cruciform, and the tail is long.</p>

  <p>The plastron consists of nine plates, and is covered with six pairs of shields, the most
  anterior of which are the broad gulars. The nuchal plate has no rib-like processes. The neurals
  form a continuous series, and there are twenty-three marginal scutes. The temporal fossae are
  completely roofed over, owing to the long sutures formed by the parietals with the postfrontals,
  moreover the postfrontals expand laterally so much that they posteriorly come into broad contact
  with the quadrato-jugals and squamosals, anteriorly with the maxillaries, so that the jugals are
  completely surrounded by bones, and are shut off from the orbits and from the temporal fossae.
  This is a unique arrangement, found nowhere else in Tortoises. The pubic and ischiadic symphyses
  are connected with each other by ligaments only.</p>

  <p>The general appearance of this water-tortoise is rather curious, since the carapace is much
  depressed, looking, especially in younger specimens, as if it had been crushed in. The head,
  provided with very strong hooked jaws, is strikingly heavy and large, and is covered above with
  one single large shield. The tail is longer than the shell, which, in full-grown specimens,
  reaches about six inches in length; it is, throughout its length, covered with rings of squarish
  shields. A large specimen measures 14 inches in total length, of which only five fall to the
  shell.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Testudinidae.</b>&ndash;The shell is always covered with well-developed horny
  shields. Those which form the plastral bridge are in direct contact with the marginals. The
  plastron is composed of nine bones. The digits have four or five claws. The neck is completely
  retractile. The skull is devoid of parieto-squamosal arches.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page346"><span class="smaller">{346}</span></span></div>

  <p>This large family is cosmopolitan, with the exception of the Australian and the adjoining
  Austro-Malayan countries. It contains genera which form a continuous gradation between absolutely
  terrestrial and thoroughly aquatic tortoises; and many are truly amphibious. As a general rule the
  typically terrestrial kinds have a more curved or arched shell, the digits are short, the eggs are
  more oval or round, and they are chiefly herbivorous; the essentially aquatic kinds have a flatter
  or depressed shell, webbed feet, with longer, often slender claws, the eggs are more cylindrical,
  and they live on animal diet. About 20 genera, with more than 110 species, are recognised by
  Boulenger, but their essential characters are nearly all internal, and therefore of no avail for
  the determination of live or entire specimens.</p>

  <p><i>Chrysemys.</i>&ndash;One of the most typical and widely distributed genera of American
  Terrapins or water-tortoises. The carapace is flat; the plastron is quite immovable, with a
  strongly developed bridge. Feet well webbed. Tail short. Skull with a broad, complete, lateral,
  temporal arch. About one dozen species, mostly in the eastern half of the United States, but the
  whole genus ranges from Canada to Argentina.</p>

  <p>Most of the young <i>Chrysemys</i> are very pretty, the ground-colour of the upper shields
  being green, variegated with yellowish-brown or blackish markings, which often form exquisitely
  delicate patterns, either concentrical (<i>Ch. concinna</i>, <i>Ch. rubriventris</i>), or more
  longitudinal (<i>Ch. elegans</i>), or apparently quite irregular. The ground-colour of the
  plastron is yellow, but the various species are best distinguished, at least in very young
  individuals, by the arrangement of the dark brown spots and patches. There are, for instance,
  several pairs of bold lateral and several median patches in <i>Ch. rubriventris</i>; five pairs of
  ocellated spots in <i>Ch. elegans</i>; only small median patches, where four plastral shields
  meet, in <i>Ch. concinna</i>; while the plastron of <i>Ch. picta</i> is uniformly yellow.</p>

  <p>These water-tortoises are very lively and shy, most so perhaps <i>Ch. picta</i>, which is very
  quick and active. The food varies, often according to individual fancy. Most of them eat fish.
  <i>Ch. picta</i> is partial to insects, but it also takes worms. Some of my specimens refused meat
  for a long time, but ultimately they became so fond of it and of worms, that they came out of the
  pond to take the food from the fingers; those in the Zoological <span class="pagenum"
  id="page347"><span class="smaller">{347}</span></span>Gardens of London have developed a taste for
  biscuits. One of my largest <i>Ch. concinna</i> fasted deliberately for eight months, refusing
  worms, insects, meat, and frogs, only occasionally sniffing at the food, until it was tempted with
  whitebait, which it took greedily. It refused, however, smelts and pieces of soles, but after
  another month it condescended to take meat regularly. Very young individuals live chiefly on
  flies, which they watch for near the surface of the water; and they are fond of smooth
  caterpillars, maggots, the larvae of humble-bees, and similar soft creatures. They all spend most
  of their time in the water, preferably floating near the surface, hidden between weeds; and they
  are fond of basking. Some of them spend the night in the water, lying motionless on the bottom,
  with heads and limbs turned in. Others prefer hiding under moss. Those species, which, like <i>Ch.
  concinna</i> and <i>Ch. picta</i>, are common in the North, are of course perfectly hardy. For the
  winter they dig themselves holes in the banks near the water, and they do not come out again until
  the spring is well advanced. The eggs are hard-shelled, mostly long and oval, and they are hatched
  before the end of the summer. The larger species of Terrapin are eaten.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. picta</i> (Fig. 76), the "Painted Terrapin," of the Eastern United States, <i>e.g.</i>
  of New York and Long Island, is easily recognised by the much depressed shell, which is absolutely
  smooth, and without a trace of a keel. The colour above is dark olive-brown or blackish, with
  broad yellow bands across the anterior ends of the neural and costal shields. Three or four of
  these transverse bands are very conspicuous. The marginals are red, with more or less concentric
  black and yellow markings. The pretty red colour, with some black stripes, extends over the
  bridge, but the plastron itself is uniformly yellow. The soft parts are likewise prettily marked,
  the ground-colour is black-brown, with delicate bright yellow and red stripes on the sides of the
  neck, limbs, and tail. The stripes are originally yellow, but they develop an orange or red line
  in the middle, so that each red stripe is ultimately narrowly edged with yellow; or the yellow and
  red stripes alternate, for instance on the tail, which is short, narrow, and pointed. The head is
  further adorned with a pair of conspicuous bright yellow patches behind the eyes, and a smaller
  pair on the occiput. The black and yellow stripes run across the gape of the mouth, some of the
  lines even looking as if they had been <span class="pagenum" id="page348"><span
  class="smaller">{348}</span></span>painted across. The nuchal shield is elongated and very narrow,
  its anterior edge and that of the neighbouring marginals are finely serrated. Very young
  individuals are at once recognised by the prominent longitudinal median stripe of bright orange
  extending over the nuchal and neural shields; the yellow transverse bands are still absent; they
  appear when the longitudinal line vanishes.</p>

  <p>The "Painted Terrapin" is one of the few species of which, thanks to L. Agassiz,<a id="NtA_132"
  href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> complete data of growth from the new born to old age are
  known. During the first six or seven years the rate of growth is so uniform that numerous
  specimens collected at the same time are readily arranged in sets of the same age, simply by the
  differences they show in their size. The successive lines of growth on the shields indicate the
  number of years. After the seventh year the age is much more difficult to distinguish in those
  tortoises, which, like <i>Ch. picta</i>, have a perfectly smooth epidermis. This smoothness is due
  to the fact that the shields undergo a process of moulting. An upper, quite <span class="pagenum"
  id="page349"><span class="smaller">{349}</span></span>transparent layer of each shield peels off
  completely like a piece of mica. I have been able to confirm Agassiz' statement on <i>Ch.
  concinna</i> in their third and fourth springs, and on a number of adult <i>Ch. picta</i>. The
  latter were not allowed to hibernate, being kept in a warm tank; they peeled completely during the
  late autumn, and then the red and yellow colours underlying the newly formed shields appeared very
  vividly; others moult at midsummer.</p>

  <p>The size of the eggs varies considerably, from 26 by 17 to 30 by 16 millimeters; sometimes they
  are perfectly round, 17 mm. in diameter.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. concinna.</i>&ndash;The specific character by which this Terrapin may be easily
  recognised is a pair of orange-red broad streaks, which extend from above the eye to the sides of
  the neck. The general colour is olive-brown above, variegated with yellowish dark-edged lines,
  which, together with numerous rugosities, radiate from the middle field of each shield. The
  plastron is yellow, often with blackish symmetrical patches, and sometimes these become confluent
  and preponderant. Very young specimens are extremely pretty, the ground-colour of the carapace
  being green, each shield with darker, somewhat concentric markings, most conspicuous and regular
  on the upper surface of the marginals, where the marks of the adjoining shields form one
  pattern-system across the dividing lines. The plastron is either uniform yellow or has a few pairs
  of blackish spots <span class="pagenum" id="page350"><span
  class="smaller">{350}</span></span>which stand so closely together that they form almost median
  patches.</p>

  <p>The carapace is rough. The horny shields become very thin with age. The anterior margin of the
  small nuchal and the neighbouring marginals is faintly serrated. The posterior marginals form
  slight notches or indentations between their edges. The plastron is almost square behind. The
  edges of the jaws are nearly smooth, without hook and receiving-notch. The tail is short.</p>

  <p>This species inhabits the South-Eastern States of North America, from Missouri and North
  Carolina to the Gulf of Mexico. Very large female specimens have a shell sixteen inches in length.
  The eggs measure from 33 by 25 to 39 by 25 mm. or about 1&frac12; inch in the long diameter.</p>

  <p><i>Emys.</i>&ndash;The plastron is movably united to the carapace by ligament, and in the adult
  has a slightly flexible hinge across the middle, between the hyo- and hypo-plastral plates and the
  pectoral and abdominal shields. The plastron is large, but does not quite close the box. Besides
  the small nuchal there are twelve pairs <span class="pagenum" id="page351"><span
  class="smaller">{351}</span></span>of marginal shields. The head is covered with smooth skin; the
  temporal arch is complete. The limbs are extensively webbed. The tail of the very young is nearly
  as long as the shell, but it becomes relatively shorter with age, being reduced in the males to
  about two-thirds, in the females to half the length of the shell. Only two species are found in
  Europe, the other, <i>E. blandingi</i>, in Canada and north-eastern U.S.A.</p>

  <p><i>E. orbicularis</i> s. <i>europaea</i> s. <i>lutaria</i>, the European
  Pond-tortoise.&ndash;The shape and coloration of the shell change likewise much with age. In the
  very young the shell is round, and the shields are rough and slightly keeled, uniform dark brown
  above, black below, with a yellow spot on each marginal and plastral shield. When half grown the
  dorsal shields become quite smooth, and are striated or spotted, with yellow upon a dark ground.
  The head, limbs, and tail are dark, with yellow or light brown spots and small dots. In very old
  specimens all these yellow marks disappear on the shell, which then becomes uniform brown or
  almost black. The coloration is subject to much local and individual variation, and there are two
  main types, the spotted and the radiate. It is difficult to say which of the two is the prettier.
  One male which I caught in the Alemtejo was very beautiful. The shell was almost black with a
  greenish shine when in the water, and had many bright yellow and whitish spots. In the radiate
  type the yellow is sometimes preponderant, so that each shield becomes a study of delicately
  painted yellow, brown, and blackish lines radiating from the centre. This variety seems to prevail
  in the south of Spain, decidedly so in the Marismas, also in Northern Italy, whence most of the
  European markets are supplied. The largest shell in the British Museum is 19 cm. = 7&frac12; inches long.
  Fischer Sigwart received one from Naples which was about 9 inches long, and this seems to have
  been kept as a pet, since its shell had been gilt. Specimens about 5 inches in length may be
  considered as fully adult. There are very few reliable observations on the growth of individuals.
  One of F. Sigwart's grew in eleven years only about 2.5 cm. = 1 inch, when its shell was 13.4 cm.
  = 5&frac14; inches long&ndash;total weight of the tortoise 491 grammes, about 1 lb. One of my own grew
  from 11 to 13.2 cm. shell-length, and 8.3 to 10.6 cm. in width within eight years, but this was
  one of the specimens which, living in a greenhouse, <span class="pagenum" id="page352"><span
  class="smaller">{352}</span></span>did not hibernate. This European pond-tortoise is now
  restricted to Southern and Middle Europe, extending eastwards towards St. Petersburg and into Asia
  Minor, southwards into Algeria. Formerly it had a much wider range, having been found in
  post-glacial deposits in Southern Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and in East Anglia. Specimens
  have been found in the peat of the fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, contemporary with bones of
  the Beaver, Roe-deer, and Pelican. The same applies to North Germany, where its gradual
  disappearance from the western and central parts is obvious. Except in Central France it is now
  practically unknown to the west of the Elbe river. The country between the Elbe and Oder is now
  debatable ground, <i>Emys</i> being exceedingly rare. Some fifty years ago this seems to have been
  different, to judge from the fact that farmers were rather fond of keeping a tortoise in the
  water-troughs of the cattle to keep the water free from worms and other impurities. Hence arose a
  silly superstitious custom. It was considered equally conducive to the health of the pigs to keep
  a tortoise in the foul tub into which all the dish-water and kitchen-refuse&ndash;as potato-peels,
  sour milk, etc.,&ndash;were collected before the mess was given to the pigs.</p>

  <p>A specimen is still occasionally caught in the Havel and Spree rivers. I myself have heard of
  one or two in the backwaters of the Oder near Frankfurt, but they are vanishing, and it is
  difficult to say exactly why. The universal lowering of the water-level owing to better drainage
  cannot quite account for it, since there are thousands of suitable ponds, swamps, and backwaters
  left. In Poland and in Eastern Prussia the tortoise is still common.</p>

  <p>This creature lives on a strictly animal diet. Worms, insects, frogs, fishes form its main
  sustenance. Fishes are regularly stalked. The tortoise watches its opportunity, slowly it half
  crawls, half swims along the bottom, rises imperceptibly by a few gentle movements of the widely
  spread-out webbed feet, then opens its sharp cutting jaws wide, and makes a grab at the belly of
  the fish. Frogs are most easily stalked when they sit upon a floating leaf. The tortoise rises
  from below, and often waits with the nostrils and eyes just above the water and close to the frog.
  After a while it sinks, and rises again, this time actually touching the toes of the
  non-suspecting frog, smelling at them and deliberately biting with a sideward turn of the
  head.</p>

  <p>What the jaws have got hold of is not allowed to escape again. The tortoise holds on and tears
  the prey to pieces with the sharp-clawed fingers. This takes a long time, only the scraped-off
  flesh and the intestines being eaten. The skeleton remains and sinks to the bottom, while in the
  case of a fish, the air-bladder floats away on the surface, and remains there as one of the surest
  signs of the existence of tortoises in that locality. The bones are cleaned with wonderful
  neatness. Some of my grass-snakes shared this fate, their backbones, with the hundreds of pairs of
  ribs, being picked or rather scraped clean, scarcely less well than if they had been prepared for
  a museum.</p>

  <p>As a rule the prey must be in motion to be seized, unless the tortoise has watched it before,
  and even then the latter prefers to smell it before biting. In captivity they soon learn to eat
  meat, and they become very tame, but in their native haunts they are extremely shy and cautious.
  Fond of basking upon a stone or on the banks, with the four limbs sprawling, or with the
  hind-limbs stretched backwards, and with the webs spread out so as to offer as large a surface as
  possible to the rays of the sun, they lie motionless for hours and appear fast asleep. But the
  slightest noise, or any other sign of our approach, is sufficient to send them plumping into the
  water, and to make them scuttle along with unsuspected agility. Nothing but the audible plump of
  the flat body and the widening rings of the disturbed water indicate their presence. After a long
  time of waiting we give it up, and turn away. That very instant we see a little ripple, caused by
  the withdrawing of the tortoise, which had come to the surface and had been watching us, with only
  the nose and eyes peeping out of the water, the rest being concealed between the floating
  vegetation. Apparently they cannot see us well with their eyes still under water, owing to the
  difference of refraction, otherwise they would not peep out and then at once turn back. It is
  certainly not for the want of air, since they can remain below for many hours without
  breathing.</p>

  <p>Although they generally feed in the water, they come on land when tame and hungry enough to
  take the offered food. Sometimes they make long migrations, perhaps because their old home is
  dried up or does not yield food enough. They hibernate during the cold season, buried in the mud,
  and they do not appear until <span class="pagenum" id="page355"><span
  class="smaller">{355}</span></span>the spring is well advanced. During the pairing season, on warm
  spring nights, they emit short piping sounds, and when they have found each other, the couple swim
  about together. The white, hard-shelled, long, oval eggs, averaging 25 to 15 mm., and about ten in
  number, are laid on land. This is a very laborious and curious business. The female having
  selected a suitable spot, not loose sand, but rather hard soil free from grass and other dense
  vegetation, prepares the ground by moistening it from the bladder and the anal water-sacs. Then it
  stiffens the tail and bores a hole with it, moving the tail but not the body. The hind-limbs then
  scoop out the hole, the broad feet moving alternately and heaping up the soil on the side, until
  the hole is about five inches deep, that is as far as the hind legs will reach. The eggs are laid
  at the bottom in one layer, divided and distributed by the feet. Lastly, the soil is put in again,
  and the tortoise, by repeatedly raising its body and falling down, stamps the soil firm and flat,
  roughens the surface a little with its claws, and leaves the nest to its fate. Nothing but an
  accident leads to its discovery. The young are hatched, according to locality and the kind of
  season, either in the same autumn or not until the next spring. Eggs laid in a garden at Kieff, in
  Russia, were hatched eleven months later. This implies hibernation of the embryo within the egg,
  and this is probably the usual course of events, resembling the conditions of the development of
  <i>Sphenodon</i> (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page299">299</a></span>). The pretty little
  creatures, scarcely larger than a shilling-piece, are exceedingly difficult to rear. They require
  a tank with green vegetation, stones to bask on and to hide under, and also dry ground and moss
  for a change. They eat flies, tiny worms, tadpoles, etc., greedily enough, but for some occult
  reasons they do less well than many another kind of water-tortoise. Miss Durham has, however,
  succeeded in rearing one, which is now in its fourth year; the shell is 2 inches long, and each
  shield shows three annual rings around the areola. This specimen spent the winters in an unheated
  room under moss, not in the water.</p>

  <p><i>E. blandingi</i>, the North American species, has a more elongated and decidedly higher
  carapace than its smaller European relation. The carapace is dull black with many pale yellowish
  spots; the plastron is yellow, with a large dark patch on the outer and hinder corner of each
  shield. The head is dark brown above, bright <span class="pagenum" id="page356"><span
  class="smaller">{356}</span></span>yellow below and on the throat, a contrast which gives this
  tortoise a striking appearance. This species is extremely voracious, becomes easily tame, and
  spends a great part of the day on land, hiding under grass to avoid great heat, and withdrawing
  into the water for the night.</p>

  <p><i>Clemmys.</i>&ndash;The plastron is immovably united with the carapace, and is devoid of any
  transverse hinge. The skull has a complete bony temporal arch. This genus, consisting of eight
  species, is otherwise very much like <i>Emys</i>, and is truly Periarctic.</p>

  <p><i>C. leprosa</i> s. <i>sigris</i> (Fig. 79).&ndash;The upper jaw has a median notch for the
  reception of the upturned point of the lower jaw; the cutting edges of the powerful beak are
  smooth. The shell is flat and long-oval, nowhere serrated. The plastron does not quite fill the
  box. In the young the shell is nearly round, and the horny shields form three series of keels, of
  which the lateral pair disappear early; the shields are olive-brown, each with an orange spot or
  streak; the plastron is dark brown, with a yellowish margin. The adult looks very different. The
  shell has become much more oval, with the greatest width behind the bridge. The long shields are
  smooth, and in elderly specimens are without any trace of the original connective rings of growth.
  The general colour of the shell is uniform pale olive-grey, inclining to yellow on the plastron.
  The ground-colour of the soft parts is olive-grey, but the sides of the head are adorned with
  orange-red or yellow marks, the patch between the eye and ear and three or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page357"><span class="smaller">{357}</span></span>four stripes on the neck being especially
  conspicuous. The limbs have pale yellowish streaks. All these markings are, however, subject to
  much individual variation. While, for instance, the half-grown creatures are distinctly agreeably
  coloured, often with a rich brown, nicely sculptured shell, and with conspicuous orange and yellow
  marks on the skin, the very old ones become rather ugly, the prevailing colour varying more and
  more into dull uniform pale olive-grey.</p>

  <p>The "Iberian Water-tortoise" is typical of the Iberian Peninsula, and extends through Morocco
  and Algeria far into North-Western Africa. Unknown to the north of the Cantabrian range, decidedly
  scarcer than its cousin <i>Emys</i> in the northern half of the Peninsula, it becomes common in
  the south. In the Alemtejo, in the lower parts of Andalucia and in Morocco, there is scarcely a
  pool, stream, or river in which it is not found, feeding on any living thing it can master,
  although fishes and frogs are its principal prey. When the streams and watercourses run dry,
  during the hot and dry season, the tortoises crowd together into the remaining pools, which soon
  become stagnant and filthy. But even these havens of refuge are not of lasting avail. They are
  soon cleared of anything edible, and the stinking water becomes dirtier and hotter day by day.
  Ultimately the tortoises leave the pool to hide under ledges of rocks, where they aestivate for
  months. This life in the muddy, slimy pools renders these tortoises peculiarly liable to the
  attacks of a certain fresh-water alga, which enters through the cracks in the horny shields and
  then flourishes in the Malpighian layer, and even in the underlying bone itself. This becomes
  gangrenous in patches, and the whole shell assumes a leprous appearance, hence the specific name
  of <i>leprosa</i>. Everything combines in favour of this destructive little alga. The tortoise,
  covered with mud, basks in the hot sun, the horny shields become brittle and crack, often peeling
  off in thin flakes. But those happy individuals which inhabit permanent rivers, or pools which do
  not dry up, are, and remain, as clean as other water-tortoises.</p>

  <p><i>C. leprosa</i> has a most disagreeable, offensive smell, something like concentrated essence
  of fish, due to the secretion of a pair of large glands situated beneath the skin of the inguinal
  region, and opening behind the bridge. Freshly caught specimens stink horribly, but when they have
  become accustomed to being <span class="pagenum" id="page358"><span
  class="smaller">{358}</span></span>handled, they no longer void these glands. They always withdraw
  into the water for the night, and the cold season is spent in the mud. Their time of propagation
  is still somewhat doubtful. Very young tortoises are met with in the Peninsula in March, when they
  are already in the rivers. Those which I imported in the summer and autumn invariably dug their
  nests and laid their long, oval eggs (28 to 33 mm. long) in the month of November, pairing having
  taken place some two or three months previously. The mode of making the nest is exactly the same
  as that described for <i>Emys</i>. As most of my specimens were kept in a greenhouse with a
  permanent current of warm water through their tanks, they never hibernated, nor did they pass
  through a torpid time in the summer, but they showed an irresistible love for the hot-water pipes,
  huddling together by the dozen, so that the pipes had to be screened off to prevent the creatures
  from getting burnt. Until this precaution was taken, they heated themselves so much that the
  shields and even the bones of the plastron were injured. The artificial warm temperature and the
  complete suppression of seasonal rest had no bad influence, most of the tortoises living with
  undiminished appetite for more than twelve years, but the sexual period became disturbed, pairing
  occurring ultimately at all times of the year. The eagerness of the males, however, had a peculiar
  evil secondary influence upon the females. The male tries to fasten on to its mate by biting into
  the collar-like fold of the neck into which the head is withdrawn, and this repeated irritation
  produces sores and swellings, which latter in their turn prevent the female from wiping the eyes
  with the back of the fore-limbs, a habit common to most, if not all, tortoises. Ultimately the
  eyes fester, and the tortoise, becoming practically blind, falls off its feed, leaves the water,
  which makes matters worse, and is very difficult to cure.</p>

  <p>In other respects they are very hardy, and they stand acclimatisation in England perfectly.
  Some, thriving in a deep concreted pond, passed through the very severe winters of several years
  ago, hiding in the mud below the ice, and appeared in the spring in perfect health. They can also
  successfully pass the winter under moss and a heap of loose garden-rubbish.</p>

  <p><i>C. caspica</i> is closely allied to <i>C. leprosa</i>, which it represents in the Balkan
  Peninsula and in Asia Minor. It differs from the south-western species chiefly by having the
  cutting edges of the <span class="pagenum" id="page359"><span
  class="smaller">{359}</span></span>upper jaw finely denticulated, and by its prettier coloration,
  each shield being ornamented with yellowish streaks which form a kind of &infin; on the costals,
  and a ring on the marginals. The plastron is black in the young, with yellow and black patches in
  the adult. The head and sides of the neck are striped with yellow lines, narrowly edged with
  black, and the rest of the soft parts is marbled dark olive and yellow. A few other species occur
  in China, Japan, and North America.</p>

  <p><i>Clemmys insculpta</i>, one of the American species, ranging from Maine to Pennsylvania and
  New Jersey, is easily recognised by the peculiar reddish-brown and brick-dust colour of the soft
  parts. The strongly keeled, posteriorly emarginate carapace is reddish brown, with radiating
  yellow lines. Each shield is delicately sculptured. The plastron, which is notched behind, is
  yellow, with a large black patch on the outer corner of each shield. Length of a full-grown
  specimen 8 inches. They frequent the rivers and ponds, but are also very fond of leaving the
  water, sometimes remaining for months in dry places.</p>

  <p><i>Malacoclemmys</i> of North America, with three species only, is closely allied to
  <i>Clemmys</i>, from which it differs chiefly by the very broad alveolar surface of the upper jaw,
  and by the more forward position of the entoplastron, this being placed anteriorly to the
  humero-pectoral suture. We mention this genus since one of its species, <i>M. terrapin</i>, is so
  extensively eaten in the Eastern United States. The shell is oval, slightly emarginate behind,
  obtusely carinated along the middle line. The upper parts of the shell are brown or greenish, with
  dark concentric lines; the marginals are yellow below, each with a ring of dark grey, and forming
  a peculiarly up-turned rim. The plastron is yellowish, either with concentric stripes and dusky
  lines or uniform yellow. But it is the colour of the soft parts which gives this otherwise
  dull-looking creature its delicately pretty appearance. The skin is, namely, greenish white with
  countless small black dots. The males remain much smaller than the females, and have the
  concentric stripes more pronounced. This species, the choicest of the edible Terrapins, frequents
  the salt marshes of the east coast of North America, from Rhode Island to the Gulf of Mexico,
  being most abundant around Charleston.</p>

  <p>The following is a condensed account of an article which appeared in the New York Sun, 18th
  September 1898, the data <span class="pagenum" id="page360"><span
  class="smaller">{360}</span></span>of which were supplied by the manager of the terrapin-farm at
  Beaulieu, Georgia. The continued hunting and the unfailing demand for them are making them very
  scarce, so that enterprising men have established terrapin-farms or "crawls" for the keeping and
  breeding of terrapins. The "crawls" in question are near the river. The larger is 310 by 60 feet,
  and is divided into three compartments for three sizes. The smaller "crawl" is for the babies, and
  is 100 by 8 feet. Through both "crawls" runs a ditch connected with the river and making a circuit
  of the farm. The bottom of the "crawls" is on a level with the low tide, and is covered with a
  layer of mud about six inches deep. Into this the terrapins burrow in the winter. The average
  population of terrapins is about 40,000, one half "bulls" and the other half "heifers." The latter
  are much better eating, and grow to a much larger size, namely, eight inches on the plastron,
  while the "bulls" rarely grow over five inches long. When a female reaches six to eight inches it
  is called a "count." Those between five-and-a-half to six inches long are known as
  "two-for-threes," while those from five to five-and-a-half inches are known as "halves." They are
  fed exclusively on shrimps and crabs on account of the flavour, although they will eat almost
  anything. The 40,000 consume on an average twenty bushels of crustaceans a day. They are quite
  indifferent to cold. The manager saw some placed in a block of ice and frozen fast to it; after
  four or five days they were chopped out, thawed, and were soon as lively as ever. The statement
  that it takes these terrapins only seven years to attain full commercial growth is surprising, and
  is probably an underestimate. At the end of the large "crawl" is a board to enable the females to
  creep into a sand-pit, where they lay the eggs from April to June, eight to twelve forming a set.
  It is necessary to get the babies away from their parents as soon as they hatch, else they will be
  eaten. The young must not be exposed to the cold. The old ones have a large amount of curiosity.
  The best way of catching them is for two men to go out in a boat with a net. They row carefully
  along until they come to a likely spot. Then one man raps several times sharply on the boat with a
  stick, and if there are any terrapin about they will come to the surface just as fast as they can
  get there to see what is going on, and the other man scoops them up with a little net. Another
  <span class="pagenum" id="page361"><span class="smaller">{361}</span></span>way, used in the salt
  marshes, is for the negroes to go tramping through the mud and water. If they pass any terrapin
  these will rise out of the mud to see what the disturbance is. The captives are then fattened in
  the "crawl." When the men go in to feed them they whistle, and terrapin from all over the "crawl,"
  thousands of them, come swimming through the water, piling over each other in their efforts to get
  close to the man with the shrimps and crabs.</p>

  <p><i>Cistudo.</i>&ndash;The plastron, without forming a bridge, is connected with the carapace by
  ligaments, and is divided into two movable lobes, the transverse hinge being so perfect that the
  box can be completely closed after head, legs, and tail have been withdrawn. The nuchal shield is
  very small; the first four neurals are large and broad, the fifth much broader than long. There
  are twelve pairs of marginal shields. The carapace is high and arched. The digits are almost
  completely free. The tail is very short. The skull is without a bony temporal arch, the
  quadrato-jugal and the jugal being absent. Only two species, in North America.</p>

  <p><i>C. carolina</i> of the Eastern United States is a very interesting species. Closely allied
  by its internal structure to the water-tortoises, it has become absolutely terrestrial; and the
  shape of the head, the convex shell which is coloured black and yellow or orange-brown, and the
  short webless fingers are all terrestrial features. But the rather long toes, provided with long
  and sharp claws, the broad and flat feet, enlarged by a broad fold of skin on the outer margin,
  the long oval eggs, the smooth covering of the head, and the preponderant animal diet, still
  proclaim the aquatic relationship of this tortoise. It is in fact a genus which has changed habits
  and features from aquatic to terrestrial life. The head is covered with a smooth skin, and the
  upper beak, especially in old specimens, is strongly and broadly hooked. The eyes of the males are
  red, those of the females are brown. The plastron of the males is concave, that of the females is
  flat. Large females reach a length of nearly six inches. The young are nearly round, with high,
  arched back and prominent keels. The keels of the middle line remain a long time, but they
  gradually flatten down with age, being prominent only at their posterior ends. Each dorsal shield
  is originally nicely sculptured, with a well-marked areola and concentric rings. Very old
  individuals <span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span class="smaller">{362}</span></span>become
  much flatter on the top of the shell, but the sides remain steep, so that the whole shell roughly
  resembles a somewhat oblong box with the corners rounded off, and the whole upper surface rubbed
  down quite smooth. The variations of colour are almost endless, and they occur in the same
  localities. I have a number of all ages from Long Island, near New York. The half-grown are
  beautifully reddish or orange-brown with dark patches, median keels prominent, plastron uniform
  black-brown. In others the dark-brown prevails over the lighter markings, which are yellower and
  more spotted or dotted than patched. Some of the oldest, with quite smooth shells, are black, with
  small, round, light yellow spots. Others are vermiculated or striped with yellow and black. The
  soft parts vary to the same extent, some showing on the neck a beautiful intricate pattern of
  yellow, reddish and brown, while in others these colours are arranged more or less in longitudinal
  stripes.</p>

  <p>These "Box-tortoises" are often caught in the States and kept as pets in the gardens, and their
  owners mark them by cutting their initials into the plastron. These marks heal up and widen in
  time like letters cut into the bark of a tree. One of my specimens, certainly a very old one to
  judge from his hooked beak, perfectly smooth and flat shell, and from the condition of the
  marginals, which have the edges rubbed down quite smooth and rounded off, has two initials and the
  date 1837 on its plastron. Of course there is no proof that the date had been cut in that year,
  more than sixty-three years ago, but it was done a long time ago. The scars on those parts of the
  shell which touch the ground are almost effaced, and the letters and figures have become somewhat
  distorted owing to the usual unequal, not concentrical, peripheral growth. Moreover, this tortoise
  must have been already adult, although not quite fully grown, since the marks are large and were
  evidently put in such a size and position as to fit the available space. I may mention that this
  record tortoise was, when I got it, not kept in confinement, but had been picked up at large.</p>

  <p>These Box-tortoises become very tame. Although fond of drinking quantities of water in long and
  slowly repeated draughts, they do not go into the water, and if they fall in accidentally they are
  liable to get drowned. They enjoy a mixed diet, but animal food predominates, consisting chiefly
  of snails, the shells of <span class="pagenum" id="page363"><span
  class="smaller">{363}</span></span>which are passed, slugs, earthworms, maggots, and soft
  caterpillars. Their fondness for slugs is all the more remarkable since scarcely any other
  Vertebrate eats these slimy, sticky molluscs; but a Box-tortoise will make a meal of two or more
  fat specimens of the black slug <i>Arion</i>, and it will eat dozens of small slugs. It first
  deliberately smells the prey, turns the head sidewards and gives a bite, whereupon first the
  intestines and then the rest are eaten. The slime is later on scraped off with the fore-limbs, or
  the head is rubbed against the grass. The favourite time of feeding is towards dusk or in the
  early dewy morning, and they are especially lively during a soft, warm rain. They also relish
  various kinds of fungi and fruit, for instance half-rotten bananas. Close observation of their
  habits gives us indications as to how the change from carnivorous to herbivorous habits may have
  taken place. Accidentally many a blade of grass is bitten off and swallowed together with the
  molluscs, also bits of rotten wood and moss, and their excrements are often full of such more or
  less digested matter. They are not very fond of basking, although they love warmth, creeping into
  the grass, where they make a shallow form by moving the shell backwards and forwards. During the
  cooler nights they frequently retire into a hole or under a log of wood. They require to
  hibernate. If kept in a warm house they become restless in the autumn, refuse food, drink and feed
  again after some weeks, but are liable to die during the winter. If they can find a cool place
  they bury themselves and sleep for several months. If left out of doors they dig into the ground,
  creep into a hole, at the bottom of which they half bury themselves, or they hide under a heap of
  garden-rubbish well out of the reach of frost. Warm April days bring them out, and the first
  requirement is a drink.</p>

  <p>When walking about in search of food they assume a curious attitude, with the shell well above
  the ground, the long neck stretched out and raised high. Their temper varies individually. Some
  become tame readily and lose all shyness, and creep up to their friend to take food from his
  fingers. Others are decidedly shy and sulky, withdrawing with a hiss into the shell, which in some
  specimens shuts almost hermetically all round, and they do not come out until all imaginary danger
  is past. One of my males sulked thus for several months, at least we never saw anything of it
  except the closed shell, but it did not starve itself. <span class="pagenum" id="page364"><span
  class="smaller">{364}</span></span>Propagation takes place in the summer, the long oval
  hard-shelled eggs being laid in June and July.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">typical Land-tortoises</span> are easily recognised by their feet. The
  digits are short, have not more than two joints, and are without any trace of webs; the
  metacarpals are scarcely longer than broad. The hind-feet are club-footed. The skin on the
  anterior side of the fore-limbs is covered with strong horny scales, frequently with dermal
  ossifications. The plastron is united suturally by a broad bridge with the usually strongly arched
  carapace. The skull has complete postorbital and temporal arches. The top of the head is covered
  with shields. The tail is short. There are only a few recent genera, modifications of the central
  and typical genus <i>Testudo</i>. The latter is cosmopolitan in the warmer temperate and tropical
  regions, except in the Australian and Austro-Malayan countries.</p>

  <p><i>Cinyxis</i> (Fig. 82) with a few species in Tropical Africa from the Gambia and from
  Abyssinia to the Equator is remarkable for the unique modification of its carapace, the posterior
  portion of which is movable, the hinge passing between the seventh and eighth marginal and the
  fourth and fifth costal plates, externally behind the seventh marginal and the second costal
  shields. In the middle of the back the hinge is imperfect, the parts being merely flexible enough
  to permit the posterior half of the box to be closed. The head is covered with shields.</p>

  <p><i>C. belliana</i>, of Northern Tropical Africa, has a small nuchal shield, and the margin of
  the carapace is smooth. Length of shell up to seven or eight inches. <i>C. homeana</i>, of West
  Africa, has likewise a small nuchal shield, but the posterior portion of the carapace descends
  vertically, and the marginals are strongly reverted and serrated. <i>C. erosa</i> (Fig. 82), also
  from West Africa, has no nuchal shield; the marginals are reverted and serrated, but the posterior
  part of the carapace is sloping, and the anterior <span class="pagenum" id="page365"><span
  class="smaller">{365}</span></span>portion of the plastron is strongly forked in front, and
  projects beyond the anterior border of the carapace. This peculiar creature reaches a length of
  nine inches. When withdrawn within the shell, which is closed behind and depressed in front, with
  the jagged edges of the plastron and the anterior marginals protecting the drawn-in head, it has a
  very quaint appearance. It lives entirely on fruit and other vegetable matter, and is said to
  prefer to lie in the water, while <i>C. belliana</i> is supposed to be entirely terrestrial.</p>

  <p><i>Pyxis arachnoides</i>, of Madagascar, a small land-tortoise, only four inches in length, has
  an immovable carapace, but the front lobe of the plastron is hinged.</p>

  <p><i>Testudo.</i>&ndash;The plastron is immovable, except that in old individuals of some
  species, e.g. <i>T. ibera</i>, the hinder lobe develops a transverse flexible hinge. They have
  existed since the Oligocene of North America and Europe; and are now represented by nearly forty
  species in all the tropical and warmer temperate countries excepting the Austro-Malayan and
  Australian region. Typically terrestrial, herbivorous and frugivorous, although occasionally
  varying their diet with worms, molluscs, and insects. The eggs are hard-shelled, mostly less oval
  than those of the aquatic and semi-aquatic tortoises. The males generally remain smaller than the
  females, have a slightly longer tail, and have a concave instead of a flat plastron. Most
  land-tortoises hibernate in the ground during the cool and cold seasons, or they aestivate during
  the hot and dry months of tropical countries, but this is not an invariable rule.</p>

  <p><i>T. graeca</i>, the common "Greek Tortoise." The shell is very convex, without keels, and has
  a smooth, not serrated margin. <span class="pagenum" id="page366"><span
  class="smaller">{366}</span></span>The nuchal shield is narrow. The fifth or last neural shield is
  much broader than the others. The supracaudal is usually divided in the median line, so that this
  is really the last pair of marginals. The plastron is notched behind; the axillary and inguinal
  shields are small. The scales on the anterior surface of the fore-limbs are small, and form from
  half-a-dozen to ten longitudinal rows. The hinder surface of the thigh is quite smooth. The tip of
  the tail ends in a conical, horny spur. The coloration of the shell varies somewhat, but the
  ground-colour is yellow, each shield with a dark brown centre and irregular patches or confluent
  spots towards the margin. The plastron has an irregular, broad black border. The soft parts are
  grey-yellowish. Some specimens are rather pale, almost lemon yellow with little black; others
  incline towards orange with more or less black. The middle fields of the shields of young
  specimens are granular, although this area is rubbed smooth with age; but the rest shows clearly
  marked concentric lines of growth. The eyes are dark, with a brown or bluish tinge, sometimes
  inclining to dark grey in very old specimens.</p>

  <p>Full-grown females have a shell six inches in length. This species inhabits the northern half
  of the Balkan Peninsula, parts of Asia Minor and Syria, Italy, and most of the islands of the
  Mediterranean, from the Grecian Archipelago to the Balearic Islands.</p>

  <p><i>T. ibera</i> is closely allied to <i>T. graeca</i>, from which it differs chiefly in the
  following points. The last pair of marginal shields are fused into an unpaired supracaudal, the
  median line of division being almost obliterated. The fifth neural shield is not broader, and
  generally a little narrower than the others. The posterior lobe of the plastron develops with age
  a transverse ligamentous hinge, and is thus rendered slightly movable, especially in the females.
  The posterior margin of the carapace is slightly expanded in old specimens. The scales of the
  fore-limb are large and imbricating, and form only four or five longitudinal rows. On the middle
  of the exposed posterior surface of the thighs the skin carries a strong, conical, horny tubercle.
  The coloration is much like that of <i>T. graeca</i>, except that the yellow of the young inclines
  to pale olive. Some specimens are uniform brownish. This species reaches a much larger size than
  <i>T. graeca</i>, old females often measuring eight inches, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page367"><span class="smaller">{367}</span></span>rarely more than nine inches in length. Its
  home is Morocco and Asia Minor, extending into Persia. It also occurs in certain parts of Southern
  Andalucia, where it breeds regularly, for instance, in the sandy pine-forests of the Marismas,
  near the mouth of the Guadalquivir. Whether it has been introduced from Morocco, or is indigenous,
  is an open question. Its specific name refers to its Iberian home.</p>

  <p><i>T. marginata</i> is worth mentioning, since it is the Greek tortoise, although not that of
  the European markets, which are supplied by the other two species. <i>T. marginata</i> is
  restricted to Greece proper, where it is the only land-tortoise. It is less closely allied to
  <i>T. graeca</i> than to <i>T. ibera</i>, of which it may be called an exaggerated form. The
  posterior margin of the carapace is much expanded or flanged, and serrated. The supracaudal is
  undivided, the posterior lobe of the plastron is movable, but the large conical spur on the thighs
  is absent. The dorsal shields of adult specimens are black with a small yellowish patch; the
  ventral shields are yellowish, each with a large black triangular patch. The British Museum
  possesses a shell 28 cm. = 11 inches in length.</p>

  <p>The habits of these Moorish and Greek tortoises are very much alike, and since they enjoy the
  distinction of frequently being kept as pets in gardens, where they are allowed to look after
  themselves, a great many incidental and odd observations have been made on them. They are
  essentially vegetable feeders, but their taste varies individually and with the season, also
  according to the vegetation of the country they happen to come from. Most of them enjoy juicy
  plants, for instance, lettuce and cabbage; the flowers of the dandelion attract them not merely by
  their bright colour; clover is also a favourite food, and an enclosure of grass-land with clover
  in it is soon cleared of the latter; grass is also taken, in default of anything better. Some of
  my specimens gradually bite large holes into gourds and pumpkins; and in Morocco I found them in
  the autumn feeding entirely on the terribly astringent green fruits of the dwarf palm
  <i>Chamaerops humilis</i>. The larger specimens bolted the fruit with the stones, passing the
  latter. In close captivity they often learn to take and to like bread soaked in milk or water.
  They drink slowly and at length, but scarcely ever when they have succulent food. There is one
  thing which they do <span class="pagenum" id="page368"><span
  class="smaller">{368}</span></span>not eat, namely, "black beetles," although they are warranted
  to do so by the men who hawk them in the streets. Worms, slugs, etc. are often mentioned as part
  of their occasional diet, but I am not aware that any of the hundreds which I have watched have
  taken such creatures, in spite of every opportunity. Their habits are very regular. They learn to
  know the geography of their domain thoroughly, and the spot selected for sleeping will be resorted
  to over and over again, be it underneath some broad leaves, under a bushy fir-tree, between a
  cluster of wallflowers, or between some tussocks, or even in an almost bare corner, the
  attractions of which are not at all obvious. Although their mental capacities cannot possibly be
  called brilliant, they soon learn to distinguish between different persons, and they will come up
  to be fed; but their memory for localities is surprising. Here is only one instance. A tortoise
  which had been put into an outhouse for hibernation was six months later taken to its usual large
  enclosure, and in the afternoon it tucked itself away on the top of a mound under precisely the
  same low bush where it used to sleep during the previous autumn. It could not see that spot from
  where it had been put down, and it did not meander about during the day, but after having enjoyed
  the warm sun it made straight for its favourite place. Dr. Girtanner of St. Gallen in Switzerland
  testifies to their appreciation of music. When the town-band began to play on the square adjoining
  his garden, all his tortoises crept as fast as possible towards the fence and remained there
  motionless with heads and necks erect. When the piece was finished they moved about, but when the
  next number began they were again spellbound. This he has observed, not on one but on many
  occasions. That they can hear, although their ears are not visible, but covered by the ordinary
  skin, is obvious enough from the fact that during the pairing season they emit feeble piping
  sounds.</p>

  <p>They are extremely fond of basking in the hot sun, sometimes allowing themselves to be almost
  baked in it, but then again at other times they seem to be anxious to seek the shade. They rise
  late and go to bed early, being absolutely diurnal. In the summer they leave their quarters when
  the sun is well up, making for a sunny spot to graze. Then they lie still and bask, unless a
  shower causes them to retreat under shelter. <span class="pagenum" id="page369"><span
  class="smaller">{369}</span></span>After some hours' rest they feed again, and in the afternoon,
  long before sunset, they go to bed. Some winters in England are of course much more severe than
  any which these tortoises experience in their native countries. Still they manage to survive them,
  provided they find a place which they can burrow into, deep enough to be out of the reach of
  frost; and if there is a heap of mould, rotting weeds, and leaves, they are probably safe.
  Sometimes they are restless, coming out again in unusually mild winters without, however, taking
  food. If they appear too early in the spring, they run the risk of terrible colds on prolonged wet
  and cold days, but in the autumn they are hardier, and can stand several degrees of dry frost.</p>

  <p>The pairing season begins in May, but lasts far into the summer. In Morocco I found them
  pairing as late as the month of September. The preliminaries extend over many days. The male
  becomes unusually active, makes a piping sound, runs after the female, draws in its head, and
  knocks with its shell against that of the female. This is repeated many times, until the female is
  excited enough to raise itself upon its hind-limbs. The eggs, only two to four in number, are laid
  several weeks later, and are buried in the ground. They are roundish-oval, hard-shelled, and vary
  according to the size of the female. Those of <i>T. graeca</i> measure on the average 30 by 24
  mm.; those of a large specimen of <i>T. ibera</i> 32 to 36 by 30 mm. The newly-hatched little
  creatures are still quite flexible, and apparently soon bury themselves before beginning their
  active life in the ensuing spring.</p>

  <p>The age which these tortoises can reach is quite unknown, but there are reliable data of
  individuals having been kept for many years. Rumpf<a id="NtA_133"
  href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> kept two <i>T. graeca</i> in his garden at
  Frankfort-on-the-Main, and let them hibernate in a box with hay in the cellar. One lived 33, the
  other 23 years. The most famous specimen of <i>T. ibera</i> is "Gilbert White's Tortoise,"<a
  id="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> which had been kept for more than 40 years before
  it came into his possession. It used to bury itself in November and to come out in April. It died
  in 1794, having reached an age of fifty-four <i>plus</i> an unknown number of years, since there
  is no record of its size when it came to England. The same applies to every other specimen which
  has been, and is being, observed as a pet. My <span class="pagenum" id="page370"><span
  class="smaller">{370}</span></span>largest Morocco female, which has a shell 7 inches long, shows
  at least 25 concentric rings of growth on the shields; the last half-dozen rings are very narrow,
  while some of those of the central area have been rubbed down. This creature is not improbably 30
  years old. A small female, which is only 5&frac14; inches long, has already 14 rings on its still perfect
  shields. Lastly, a little one, only 4 inches long, shows 7 rings. They grow fastest when they are
  about 6 to 7 inches long, and they then seem to be at their prime. White's tortoise, now enshrined
  in the National Collection, was unusually large, the shell measuring 25 cm., or nearly 10 inches;
  around the much-enlarged, rubbed-down areola of each shield are about 30 very narrow rings.</p>

  <p><i>T. horsfieldi</i> is easily recognised by its possessing only four claws on the fore- and
  hind-limbs. It is closely allied to the species last mentioned, which it seems to represent in the
  sandy districts of Transcaspia and the Kirghiz Steppes to Afghanistan.</p>

  <p><i>T. elegans</i>, the "Starred Tortoise" of the southern half of India and Ceylon, is easily
  recognised by the very convex carapace without a nuchal shield, and by the beautiful markings of
  the other shields, each of which has a yellow areola, whence radiate yellow streaks upon a black
  ground. Moreover, the dorsal shields often form humps. It reaches the length of one foot. Old
  specimens lose the beautiful yellow radiation, owing to a considerable amount of peeling off of
  the horny layers.</p>

  <p>The habits have been carefully watched by Captain Thomas Hutton,<a id="NtA_135"
  href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> who gives the following account. The tortoises live in the
  grassy jungle at the base of the hills, but owing to their colour being so blended with the rocky
  nature of the ground, they are with difficulty distinguished. Moreover, they remain concealed
  beneath shrubs or grass during the heat of the day. In the rainy season they are most active,
  wandering about all day, feeding and pairing. At the approach of the cold weather they select a
  sheltered spot and conceal themselves by thrusting their shell into some thick tuft of grass,
  remaining there in a sort of lethargic, but not torpid, inactivity until the hot season, at which
  time they remain concealed only during the heat of the day, coming out about sunset to feed.</p>

  <p>During the hot season Hutton's captives often soaked themselves <span class="pagenum"
  id="page371"><span class="smaller">{371}</span></span>in water, and they drank a great deal.
  Copulation lasted about ten minutes; the females received the males from the end of June to the
  middle of October. On the 11th of November a female dug a pit at the root of a tuft of grass,
  having previously watered the spot, then digging with the hind-limbs alternately, and continuing
  to water the soil. In two hours she had made a hole six inches deep and four wide; she then laid
  four pure white eggs, each about 1&frac34; inches or 45 mm. long, and filled the hole again with the
  prepared mud, pressing it well in with the feet and with the weight of the body. The whole
  operation took four hours. From December to the beginning of February these tortoises were
  listless, they then took water and some lucerne, but did not come out again until the middle of
  April, well in the hot season. Both males and females wrestled in a curious way. One confronted
  the other, with the head and fore-limbs drawn into the shell, and with the hind-limbs planted
  firmly on the ground, and in this manner shoving against each other in any narrow space.
  Sometimes, if one succeeded in placing its shell beneath the other, he tilted his adversary over
  on his back, from which position he had great difficulty in recovering himself.</p>

  <p><i>T. polyphemus</i>, the "Gopher Tortoise" of the south-eastern States of North America, is
  one of the few American species. It is characterised by the shape of the front lobe of the
  plastron, which is bent upwards, and extends beyond the carapace. The nuchal shield is present,
  not narrow; the supracaudal is undivided. The shell is much depressed, and flattened along the
  vertebral region, with rounded margins. The fore-limbs are armed with very strong claws. The
  general colour is very dark brown above, inclining to black; brownish yellow below, with blackish
  patches. The length of the shell is about one foot, or even eighteen inches.</p>

  <p>The Gopher is interesting for its habits, which are described by Agassiz, Schnee, and others.
  Its domicile consists of an excavation, the mouth of which is just sufficient to admit the animal,
  the burrow running in an oblique direction to the depth of about four feet. The whole passage is
  sometimes more than two yards long. It expands from the entrance, and ends in a roomy space,
  sometimes with a few branches of fir trees which have been dragged in either for food or as a
  lining. The burrow <span class="pagenum" id="page372"><span class="smaller">{372}</span></span>is
  inhabited by one pair only. When the dew is on the grass, or after rain, they emerge in search of
  food, which consists of grass, succulent vegetables, fruit, etc. They also eat the gum that exudes
  from trees, especially the resin of the pine. The eggs are laid in June, not in their domicile,
  but in a separate cavity near the entrance; a set consists of five eggs, almost round, and very
  large, namely, 40 mm., or more than one inch and a half in diameter. To capture the Gopher a deep
  hole is dug at the mouth of their home, into which they fall as they emerge for food. In Southern
  Texas and neighbouring parts of Mexico they are represented by a smaller and lighter coloured
  species.</p>

  <p><i>T. tabulata</i>, widely spread over Tropical South America, whence it is often brought over
  as a curiosity, reaches a large size, specimens nearly two feet in length being not uncommon. The
  shell is flat on the top, and is very elongated, without a nuchal, but with an undivided
  supracaudal shield. The carapace is very dark brown or black, each shield with a yellow or orange
  centre; the plastron is brown and yellow, the dark colour being mostly confined to the middle
  portion. The ground-colour of the skin of the limbs is blackish, but the scales are orange or red.
  The head is yellow and black. This species inhabits the forests, and lives chiefly on the fruits
  of trees; in captivity they are said to take bread soaked in milk or water, lemons, apples,
  bananas, cabbage, gourds, and also meat, at least the males.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Gigantic Land-tortoises</span> differ from the others in no essential points
  except their large size. The term gigantic is, however, applied to many of them by courtesy only,
  since they do not exceed the dimensions of large Turtles. A truly gigantic species, <i>T.
  atlas</i>, has left its remains in the Sivalik Hills of late Miocene or early Pliocene date. The
  skull is between seven and eight inches long, and is well preserved, but the correctness of the
  dimensions of the specimen, as it now stands, restored in the National Collection, is open to
  doubt. The shell was probably not more than six feet long. Miocene and Pliocene Europe was also
  inhabited by large tortoises, with shells about four feet long, <i>e.g.</i> <i>T. perpigniana</i>,
  whose bony plates are one inch thick; others have been found in North America. Such large
  tortoises are now restricted to two widely separated regions of the world, namely the Galapagos
  Islands (which have received their name from these creatures, <i>gal&aacute;pago</i> being one of the
  Spanish terms for <span class="pagenum" id="page373"><span
  class="smaller">{373}</span></span>tortoise), and the islands in the Western Indian Ocean, namely
  the Mascarenes (Bourbon, Mauritius, and Rodriguez), the Comoros, Aldabra, the Amirantes, and the
  Seychelles. When they became extinct in Madagascar is not known, but <i>T. grandidieri</i> was a
  very large species of apparently very recent date. Of the other islands the Comoros only were
  inhabited by man, the others were devoid of any but small and harmless Mammals. It was on these
  peaceful islands that large tortoises lived in incredible numbers, and, like the Dodo of Mauritius
  and the Solitaire of Rodriguez, grew to a size far beyond that of their less favourably placed
  continental relations. The same applies to the tortoises of the Galapagos Islands. Plenty of food,
  a congenial equable climate, and absence of enemies enabled them to enjoy existence to the fullest
  extent. There was nothing for them to do but to thrive, to feed, to propagate, to grow, and to
  vary. At least there was nothing to check variation within reasonable limits. Scattered over the
  many islands, they were prevented from inter-breeding, and thus it has come to pass that not only
  every group of islands, but in the case of the Galapagos almost every island, has or had its own
  particular kind, be these called varieties, races, forms, or species.</p>

  <p>There are four features of special interest. First, these tortoises grow to a large size, and
  there are no small species on any of these islands. Secondly, they vary much individually.
  Thirdly, each island or group of islands has developed its own kind. Lastly, there is the widely
  spread tendency to reduce the thickness of the bony plates of the carapace, in spite of its size.
  In some cases, notably <i>T. vosmaeri</i> of Rodriguez, the bony shell is reduced to apparently
  the utmost limit compatible with mechanical safety. The horny shields are, or were, however, well
  developed, sometimes much more so than in other recent land-tortoises. Whatever were the original
  reasons for the development of a strong shell in tortoises, they cannot have prevailed in these
  islands.</p>

  <p>Where did all these tortoises come from, and how did they get to these oceanic islands?
  Accidental transport or migration are out of the question. Land-tortoises are drowned within a few
  hours. Moreover, there are none of their kind on the continents of Africa, Asia, and South
  America, although they had a much wider distribution in past geological ages. Consequently we have
  to assume that they are descendants of tortoises once populating the land which, except the
  islands, lies now below <span class="pagenum" id="page374"><span
  class="smaller">{374}</span></span>the western Indian ocean. The existence of this, "Lemuria" or
  "Gondwana," came to an end in Mid-Tertiary times. The large tortoises on the remaining continents
  died out&ndash;in any case they are gone, while those which lived on, or retreated to, what became
  the present islands, survived and flourished.</p>

  <p>The tortoises were not left in peace with the advent of man, who found that they were good to
  eat. They were first exterminated on the Mascarene Islands. In 1759 four small vessels were
  specially appointed for the service of bringing tortoises from Rodriguez to Mauritius; one vessel
  carried a cargo of 6000; and altogether more than 30,000 were imported into Mauritius within the
  space of eighteen months. Dr. G&uuml;nther very properly remarks that many of these tortoises must have
  been small-sized specimens, and that many of them were probably used for provisioning passing
  Government vessels. Anyhow an inter-insular traffic was carried on, and there are records of
  superfluous tortoises having been turned loose, at the end of the voyage, in distant islands, even
  in Java. Importation and exchange of choice specimens, by way of presents, seems also to have
  taken place. All this makes it now actually impossible to trace the original habitat of the few
  surviving specimens with anything like certainty. At the beginning of this century the large
  tortoises had been nearly cleared off most of the islands, and at the present time only the south
  island of Aldabra enjoys the reputation of still possessing some really indigenous tortoises. The
  few survivors on the other islands are said to have been introduced. The small stock at Aldabra is
  now under Government protection. Representatives of various species will linger on for a little
  time to come, when they are kept as pets on some tropical islands, but those which have been
  brought to Europe are of course doomed.</p>

  <p>We can mention only a few of the large tortoises which have become famous, not to say
  historical. A fascinating r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the whole complicated question has been given by Dr.
  G&uuml;nther.<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Testudo gigantea</i> s. <i>elephantina</i> s. <i>hololissa</i> s. <i>ponderosa</i>,
  originally confined to the North Island of Aldabra, where this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page375"><span class="smaller">{375}</span></span>kind has been completely exterminated, is
  now still to be found in the Seychelles in considerable numbers, introduced there by planters, and
  kept in a state of semi-domestication. A very large specimen was received by the Hon. Walter
  Rothschild, at Tring, in 1893. In 1897 its shell measured 40&frac14; inches in length, 52&frac14; over the
  curve, and 50 inches across the curve transversely; it weighed 358 lbs. The measurements taken in
  previous years are unfortunately not free from mistakes. "Whenever the temperature was over 60&deg; F.
  this tortoise had a free run of 350 acres of grass park, and when the temperature showed
  permanently below 58&deg;, it was kept in an orchid house from September to June. When at liberty in
  the park it lived entirely on grass, but in the hothouse it fed on carrots, cabbage, lettuce, and
  several other vegetables"; it was also very fond of rotten fruit. To this species belongs the
  large tortoise which has been living at St. Helena for more than the last hundred years.</p>

  <p><i>T. daudini</i> is the species of the South Island of Aldabra. Voeltzkow, in 1895, succeeded
  in carrying off seven specimens. He gives the following description:&ndash;The island is an atoll,
  cut through in three places, with a greatest length of about twenty miles. The chief hindrance in
  the search for the tortoises is the impenetrability of the island. The soil consists entirely of
  sharp water-worn corals, with their points uppermost, while the whole is covered with such thick
  masses of low scrub, that a way has to be cut with an axe, so that an extended search over a large
  area is out of the question. To land on the outside is dangerous, on account of the heavy surf;
  while landing from the inside of the atoll is much hindered by the dense thickets of mangrove
  trees. As drinking water, and that very bad, is only found in one place, rainwater has to be
  collected from the natural hollows, and carried along in tanks. Thousands of mosquitoes prevent
  one remaining over night in those places which the tortoises frequent. Then at last, when one has
  discovered, by a stroke of luck, one of these creatures, in the thick scrub, where they hide
  during the heat of the day, the real hard work begins, namely, the conveyance of the beast. Six
  reached Europe alive, two of them were sent to Frankfort, and the four others to Hamburg. Mr.
  Rothschild received a male of <i>T. daudini</i>, which, until its recent death, was the largest
  living tortoise known. The length <span class="pagenum" id="page376"><span
  class="smaller">{376}</span></span>of its shell was 55 inches, or 67&frac12; inches over the curve; total
  weight 560 lbs. This specimen had a chequered career. Although its original home must have been
  the Aldabra atoll, it had been known for many years on Egmont Island, one of the Chagos Islands.
  According to tradition, it had been there some 150 years, but the first settlement on that island
  was formed from Mauritius only at the beginning of this century. The owner of the tortoise, M.
  Antelme, took it to Mauritius, whence it came to England. On the Egmont Island it used to bury
  itself for six months in the ground without eating anything.</p>

  <p><i>T. sumeirei.</i>&ndash;This kind is supposed to have been the species peculiar to the
  Seychelles. In 1766 five large tortoises were brought from the Seychelles to Mauritius by
  Chevalier Marion de Tresne. Of these only three were alive in 1898, two in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page377"><span class="smaller">{377}</span></span>Mauritius and one in London; the latter
  specimen soon died in the Zoological Gardens. One of the two survivors, the last of their race, is
  famous. It was kept at Port Louis, and when Mauritius became a British possession in 1810, the
  tortoise was especially mentioned and taken over. It still lives there in the grounds of the
  barracks of the garrison. According to the proverbial oldest inhabitants it had in 1810 already
  reached its present size, namely, a shell-length of about 40 inches with a greatest circumference
  of 259 cm. = 8 feet 6 inches. Total weight 160 kilo = about 358 lbs. When walking it stands 63.5
  cm. = 25.4 inches high, with the plastron about 15 cm. or 6 inches above the ground, and it can
  then carry with ease two full-grown men on its back. This old male is now nearly blind, but is
  otherwise of regular habits and in good health. Although it has been known for nearly 150 years it
  had to wait for its scientific name until the year 1892.</p>

  <p>Another famous individual is the Colombo tortoise. It is supposed to have come to Colombo from
  the Seychelles in 1798. It died in 1897. To judge from photographs, this specimen, a male, may
  possibly belong to <i>T. sumeirei</i>, in spite of the very flat shell, which is 53&frac12; inches in
  length.</p>

  <p>Leaving aside the remains of sub-fossil tortoises, <i>e.g.</i> the thin-shelled <i>T.
  vosmaeri</i> of Rodriguez, and several kinds which have been dug out in the Mare-aux-songes of
  Mauritius, one of which had a markedly forked and prolonged anterior plastral lobe, rather
  resembling that of the Pliocene Sivalik <i>T. atlas</i>, we now turn to the tortoises of the
  Galapagos Islands. They existed in enormous numbers towards the end of the seventeenth century,
  when Dampier visited those islands. Hundreds were exported and scattered early in the nineteenth
  century. When the islands became a penal settlement of Ecuador, the introduction of convicts and
  pigs proved detrimental to them, but Darwin found them still present in 1835 on most of the
  islands. His classical account of these old giants is to be found in the <i>Voyage of the
  Beagle</i>. They lived on the succulent cactus plants, leaves of trees, berries, and a kind of
  <i>Usnea</i>, a lichen pendant from the trees. They collected regularly at certain pools and
  springs, leading to which were regular well-trodden paths, formed by the coming and going of the
  tortoises. He calculated that they could walk a distance of about four miles in one day. During
  <span class="pagenum" id="page378"><span class="smaller">{378}</span></span>the time of
  propagation the males emit a hoarse bark, which can be heard a hundred yards off. The round eggs
  measure about 5 cm. or 2 inches in diameter, and are laid in the month of October, about one dozen
  making a set.</p>

  <p>Nearly every island had apparently its own kind. They are all remarkable for their small head
  and the length of their neck, which is decidedly longer and more slender than that of the Eastern
  tortoises. The most peculiar looking are or were <i>T. ephippium</i> and <i>T. abingdoni</i>, the
  shell of which is extremely thin, with large lacunae in the osseous plates. The profile of the
  shell is somewhat saddle-shaped, with the horny shields partly concave and turned upwards at the
  sides. The general colour of these and the other Galapagos tortoises is black. <i>T. ephippium</i>
  still survives on Duncan Island. Of <i>T. elephantopus</i> s. <i>vicina</i> Baur collected
  twenty-one specimens in 1893 on Albemarle Island. Some of them are still comparatively young, only
  16 inches long. A large one was killed, and, being hard up for water, Baur and his companions
  drank the five cups full of fluid contained in the pericardial sac; they found it most refreshing,
  and tasting somewhat like the white of an egg. One monster is said to have measured 56 inches over
  the curve, with a skull 7.12 inches in length. Mr. Rothschild received one of this kind
  alive&ndash;a much-travelled specimen. It came to England from Sydney, whether it had been brought
  in 1880 from Rotuma Island, north of the Fiji group. There it had probably been left with others
  by Captain Porter, who, on his voyage from the Galapagos in 1813, distributed several young
  tortoises from his stock among the chiefs, and permitted a great many to escape into the bushes
  and among the grass. The shell of this specimen measured 49&frac12; inches in length, 56 over the
  curve.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Chelonidae</b> (<i>Turtles</i>).&ndash;The limbs are paddle-shaped, and the shell is
  covered with horny shields. Only two recent genera, with three species, widely distributed in the
  seas.</p>

  <p>The neck is short and incompletely retractile. The temporal region of the skull is completely
  roofed over above and laterally by the parietals, postfrontals, squamosals, quadrato-jugals and
  jugals. All these bones are much expanded, and form the additional or false roof. The parietals
  are especially large, and are in broad contact with the squamosals. Nasals are absent. The nares
  are bordered by the small premaxillaries, the maxillaries, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page379"><span class="smaller">{379}</span></span>and the prefrontals. The choanae are
  enclosed by the palatines, which are separated by the vomer, and are posteriorly in broad contact
  with the pterygoids. The latter are connected with descending processes of the parietals by
  epipterygoids. The foramen magnum is bounded not only by the supra-occipital and the lateral
  occipitals, but also by the basi-occipital. For the skeleton see Fig. 65, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page320">320</a></span>. The pubic and ischiadic symphyses are connected by a narrow
  cartilaginous band. The pubis has a large, broad, lateral process, but the ischium is devoid of
  such a process. The paddles of the fore- and hind-limbs are produced by an elongation of the
  metacarpal and metatarsal bones and of most of the phalanges, and these have no condyles; most of
  the carpal and tarsal elements are flattened, and additional width is given to the hands by the
  much enlarged pisiform bone. The number of phalanges of the five fingers is 2, 3, 3, 2, 2; that of
  the five toes, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2.</p>

  <p>The carapace is heart-shaped and very flat. The nuchal plate has no rib-like processes. The
  eight neurals form a continuous series, and the short tail is covered by two or three pygal plates
  besides the unpaired last marginal. The number of all the <span class="pagenum" id="page380"><span
  class="smaller">{380}</span></span>marginals is 23, sometimes 25 individually. The plastron (Fig.
  66, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page321">321</a></span>) is composed of the usual nine plates,
  which, however, remain entirely free from the marginals, and are only loosely connected with each
  other, enclosing a very large unossified space. The horny shields covering the plastron number 13,
  and there is a series of about 5 inframarginals (Fig. 61, <span class="smaller">6</span>, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page315">315</a></span>). There are normally 12 pairs of marginal
  shields, a nuchal, 5 neural, and 5 or 7 costal shields. Whilst the number of these dorsal shields
  is pretty constant in <i>Chelone</i>, it is subject to an astonishing amount of individual
  variation in <i>Thalassochelys</i>.</p>

  <p>The Chelonidae are a highly specialised offshoot of the Cryptodira adapted to marine life.
  Fundamentally they agree most with the Testudinidae, paradoxical as this may appear at first
  sight. There is nothing primitive about them except the complete series of inframarginal shields.
  Fossil forerunners of marine turtle-like creatures appear in the Upper Jurassic deposits of Europe
  and North America. The numerous genera have been grouped together as Thalassemydidae and
  Chelonemydidae. They are more or less intermediate between Chelonidae and <i>Emys</i>-like
  Testudinidae, the carapace being not too much flattened and broadened out, the fontanelles between
  the ribs are mostly small, the plastral bones are still broad, enclose a smaller ossified space,
  and there is still a bony bridge in most cases. The paddle-shape of the limbs is less pronounced,
  and sometimes only indicated. In some forms, especially <i>Lytoloma</i>, from the Upper Cretaceous
  and Eocene of North America and Europe, the anterior portion of the skull is much longer than in
  the Chelonidae, the vomer and the premaxillaries are elongated, and the anterior portion of the
  roof of the mouth, with the corresponding parts of the lower jaw, seems to have carried crushing
  pads. Some of the best-known Upper Jurassic genera are <i>Eurysternum</i> and <i>Idiochelys</i>;
  <i>Plesiochelys</i> from the Purbeck and Wealden; <i>Allopleuron hofmanni</i> from the Upper
  Cretaceous of Belgium approaches <i>Chelone</i> by the large fontanelles between the small
  marginal and the short costal plates. True Chelonidae are very rare and imperfect in the
  Mid-Tertiary strata, but both recent genera seem to have existed since Pliocene times.</p>

  <p>The few recent Chelonidae are entirely marine, going on land only in order to deposit their
  eggs in the sands of unfrequented shores. Their distribution, in conformity with their oceanic
  life, <span class="pagenum" id="page381"><span class="smaller">{381}</span></span>is almost
  cosmopolitan within the warmer zones, but not a few find their way far into the temperate seas.
  They are all eagerly hunted by man either for food or for the sake of the tortoiseshell.</p>

  <p><i>Chelone.</i>&ndash;With only four pairs of costal shields. Carapace with large persisting
  fontanelles between the costal and marginal plates. Two species.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. mydas</i> (the "Green or Edible Turtle"), has when adult a nearly smooth shell, all the
  shields being juxtaposed, fitting closely into each other, and becoming quite smooth with age. The
  neural shields of younger specimens have a feeble keel. The twenty-five shields which surround the
  carapace form a smooth, or but indistinctly serrated rim. The head is covered with one pair of
  prefrontal shields, the others are small. The horny beaks of the upper and lower jaws have
  denticulated outer edges, those of the upper jaw having two pairs of strong denticulated ridges.
  The limbs have generally only one claw, namely on the first digit. This claw, although sometimes
  curved and thick, and more than an inch in length, is blunt. The general colour is olive or brown
  above, with yellowish spots or blotches; the under parts are pale yellowish. This species attains
  a large size, with a length of shell of nearly four feet, but the usual length of full-grown
  specimens is three feet, and these weigh, when in good condition, more than three hundredweight.
  Their home is in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, but there are certain regions in which
  they are more common than in others. Famous centres are the Island of Ascension, the West Indies,
  and the coast of Mosquito, at least for commercial purposes. As they require sandy, easily
  accessible beaches for the deposition of their eggs, they congregate in certain parts of the world
  more than in others, and being strictly vegetable feeders, they are naturally bound to the coasts,
  although they are sometimes met with far out at sea. Their chief food consists of algae, and of
  <i>Zostera marina</i>, the edible "Dulce," which grows plentifully in the lagoons of the coast of
  Florida. When they have eaten their fill, they are said to chop off more of these plants, and roll
  them, together with the adherent mud, into balls of the size of a head, and these balls, receding
  with the tide, are followed by the Turtles.</p>

  <p>Whilst in the water they are caught in various ways, with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page382"><span class="smaller">{382}</span></span>nets or harpoons. In some parts of the world
  the natives follow them in a boat, and when they espy a turtle crawling along the bottom, a man,
  attached to a rope, dives in, clasps it, and is brought up by his companions together with his
  prey. Turtles are fond of basking asleep, floating on the surface, and they are then harpooned
  from a stealthily approaching boat. The most original mode of catching them is that used by the
  natives of Torres Straits, Madagascar, and Cuba. The turtle-fishers go out in the boat to a spot
  frequented by grazing turtles; a long string is tied to the tail of a fish, <i>Echeneis</i>, a
  member of the Mackerel family, and the <i>Echeneis</i>, anxious to get away to protective shelter,
  makes for a turtle, and attaches itself to the turtle's plastron by means of the large sucking
  apparatus on the top of its head and neck-region. The men are guided by the string, and the turtle
  is gently coaxed up towards the surface or followed into shallow water, where it is either
  harpooned or dived for. It is curious that this use of the <i>Echeneis</i> exists in such widely
  separated parts of the world, the natives of which cannot have any knowledge of each other. These
  modes of catching turtles are sportsman-like, but the greatest and most wanton destruction is
  practised at their breeding places. In conformity with the wide distribution of these creatures,
  the time of breeding is not the same everywhere. In the West Indian region, and in the Straits of
  Malacca, it falls within the period of April to June; on the coast of West Africa it occurs from
  September to January. The females come to their breeding places from afar, reconnoitre the beach
  carefully, are extremely wary and shy, taking alarm at the slightest disturbance, and at last
  crawl on land. Well out of the reach of the tide the female scoops out a hole in the sand,
  deposits about one hundred or more of its round, rather parchment-shelled eggs, covers the nest
  carefully, obliterating all traces of the dug-out sand, and makes again for the sea by another
  route. At least they are said to make a sort of circuitous route so that nobody can tell the
  position of the nest, which may be anywhere beneath the broad trail left by the heavy creature on
  its way from and back to the sea. The nest is discovered by probing the sand with sticks. The time
  of incubation is not known, but according to Agassiz, lasts at least seven weeks.</p>

  <p>The "turning" of turtles is a cruel and wanton operation, since frequently many more are turned
  over and left to perish than are taken away. Men lying in ambush watch the beast, or they approach
  the lonely sandy shore by boat, and rush the helpless creatures when these are surprised in
  sufficient numbers. It takes several men to lift a full-grown specimen. It is therefore necessary
  to secure them by turning them over with poles or by their flippers, lest they should crawl away.
  On board ship they are either put into tanks or tied with ropes on deck, covered with a moistened
  cloth; and occasionally a piece of bread, soaked in sea-water, is thrust into the parched mouth.
  In London they are kept in large tanks, often in considerable numbers, but since they take no food
  in captivity, or rather because it is difficult to supply them with the right sort, they are not
  kept long. After the head has been cut off, the body is suspended for a day or two, in order to
  drain it of the blood. It is not only the meat and the fat which are used for the making of the
  famous soup, but also the thick and dense layer of subcutaneous tissue which lines the inside of
  the shell.</p>

  <p>Tennent describes a revolting spectacle exhibited in the markets of Jaffna, in Ceylon. The
  flesh of the turtles is sold piecemeal by the Tamil fishermen, while the animals are still alive.
  At certain seasons, says the same authority, the flesh of turtle on the south-west coast of Ceylon
  is usually avoided as poisonous, but some lamentable instances are recorded of neglect of this,
  and consequent sickness, followed by coma and death. In the Gulf of Manaar specimens are
  frequently found between four and five feet in length; and on one occasion, in riding along the
  seashore north of Putlam, he saw a man in charge of some sheep, resting under the shade of a
  turtle shell, which he had erected on sticks to protect him from the sun. In connexion with this
  curious sight, Tennent quotes Aelian's statements, copied by him from Megasthenes' <i>Indica
  Frag.</i> lix. 31, that in the Indian ocean turtles occur which measure fifteen ells, so that not
  a few people may find ample shelter beneath a single shell.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. imbricata</i> ("Hawksbill Turtle").&ndash;The number of shields covering the carapace is
  the same as in <i>Ch. mydas</i>, but they strongly imbricate, or overlap each other from before
  backwards, until the animal is very old, when the shields become juxtaposed.</p>

      Turtle"), young. &times; &frac12;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In young specimens, under one foot in length, each of the neural and costal shields is strongly
  keeled, the three rows of keels converging towards the posterior end of the shell. The neural
  series of keels is almost continuous, and remains longest, even in half-grown specimens. The
  twelve pairs of marginal shields form at first a strongly serrated sharp edge; the serrations
  disappear gradually on the front portion, but remain on the posterior half of the shell. The horny
  covers of the jaws form a hooked beak, with sharp but smooth or feebly denticulated margins. The
  fore- and hind-flippers have two claws. The young are pale brown above, blackish below; the shell
  of the adult is beautifully marbled with yellow on a rich dark-brown ground; the plastron is
  yellow. The shields and scales of the head and limbs are dark brown, with yellow margins. The top
  of the head is covered by a large unpaired frontal and a pair of prefrontal or interorbital
  shields. This Turtle does not reach the size of the green or edible kind; the largest shell on
  record is in the National Collection, and measures 85 cm. = 34 inches in length. They range over
  all the tropical and subtropical seas. They are apparently strictly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page386"><span class="smaller">{386}</span></span>carnivorous, living upon fish and molluscs,
  the shells of which they crunch. Although not eaten, they are much persecuted on account of their
  shells, the horny shields of which are the "tortoiseshell" of commerce. A large specimen yields up
  to 8 lbs. Few of the shields are, however, thick enough to be manufactured into the larger
  articles which art and fashion delight in, but if heated in oil, or boiled, they can be welded
  together under pressure, and be given any desired shape. In genuine articles of Oriental
  manufacture these welds can generally be detected, or their compound nature is indicated by the
  beautiful pattern, which is too regular in the imitations now common. Even the shavings and
  leavings can be welded and moulded into large pieces. The stripping of the shields has been
  described by Sir E. Tennent. "If taken from the animal after death and decomposition, the colour
  of the shell becomes clouded and milky, and hence the cruel expedient is resorted to of seizing
  the turtles as they repair to the shore to deposit their eggs, and suspending them over fires till
  heat makes the plates on the dorsal shields start from the bone of the carapace, after which the
  creature is permitted to escape to the water. At Celebes, where the finest tortoise-shell is
  exported to China, the natives kill the turtles by blows on the head, and immerse the shell in
  boiling water to detach the shields. Dry heat is only resorted to by the unskilful, who frequently
  destroy the tortoise-shell in the operation." The cruel process described above is resorted to
  "for economy's sake," the Singhalese believing that such maltreated turtles regenerate the
  shields, to be caught and shipped again. Since none of them are actually re-caught in the
  mutilated condition, this is looked upon as a proof of the correctness of the treatment. It is
  more likely that they die.</p>

  <p>New shields can be reproduced only if the underlying Malpighian layer of cells (<i>cf.</i> Fig.
  68, B, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page323">323</a></span>) is not killed by the roasting.
  However, Dr. Charles Hose, with his long experience in Borneo, is positive that numerous
  individuals are there caught which have imperfectly mended shells, the shields of which do not
  imbricate, are thin, and almost worthless.</p>

  <p>It is commonly believed that the same individuals return again and again to the same spot for
  laying. This is very likely the case. Tennent mentions that in the year 1826 a Hawksbill was taken
  near Hambangtotte, which bore a ring attached to one of its fins, that had been placed there by a
  Dutch <span class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>officer thirty
  years before, with a view of establishing the fact of these recurring visits to the same beach.
  The same homing instinct has been observed in some females of the Green Turtle, which, having been
  brought from the Tortugas Keys to Key West off the south end of Florida, escaped, and were, a few
  days later, re-caught at the Tortugas. On the other hand, experiments made with turtles at
  Ascension are said to have had no result.</p>

  <p><i>Thalassochelys</i>, with five pairs of costal shields. The carapace is completely ossified
  in the adult, leaving no fontanelles between the ribs and the marginals.</p>

  <p><i>Th. caretta</i> (the "Loggerhead Turtle").&ndash;The shields of the carapace imbricate only
  in young specimens, in the adult they become smooth and juxtaposed. The margin is serrated
  posteriorly. The carapace of the young has three strong keels. The intergular shield is very small
  or absent. The marginals, including the nuchal, usually number 23, rarely 25. The large head is
  armed with hooked jaws, the crushing surface of the horny upper beak has a median prominent ridge.
  The top of the head has a pair of shields in front of the unpaired frontal. The flippers of the
  young have claws on the first and second digits; in the adult usually only that of the first digit
  remains. The general colour of the shell is uniform brown above, yellowish below. Very young
  specimens are uniform dark brown or blackish above and below.</p>

  <p>Large individuals have a shell about three feet and a half in length. The Loggerhead is
  carnivorous, and is commercially of no value. Its habits seem to be the same as those of the other
  Turtles, but it has a much wider distribution. Besides all the tropical and intertropical seas, it
  inhabits the Mediterranean, and is an accidental visitor to the western coasts of Europe,
  especially Portugal and the Bay of Biscay. It has been caught several times on the coast of
  Belgium, and an old female containing 1150 eggs was captured in 1894 on the Dutch coast. In 1861
  one was caught near Penman, on the coast of Banffshire, and a second in the completely land-locked
  Loch Lomond.<a id="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> It has been more frequently
  recorded from the coast of Devon and Cornwall.</p>

  <p>The most interesting feature of the Loggerhead is the <span class="pagenum" id="page388"><span
  class="smaller">{388}</span></span>astonishing variability in the number of the horny shields of
  the carapace. The normal number of shields of the carapace, leaving out the marginals and counting
  the nuchal as the first neural, is 6 neurals and 5 pairs of costals, in all 16. The greatest
  number of dorsal shields observed is 8 neurals and 8 pairs of costals, in all 24. Many of the
  intermediate combinations have been observed, there being, for instance, specimens with 8 neurals
  and 16, 14, 13, 12, or 11 costals, the latter not being always in pairs, but unequal on the right
  and left sides; or there are 7 neurals with 20 to 16 costals, or 6 neurals with 20, 19, 18, 17, or
  16 costals. The interesting fact in connexion with these variations is, moreover, that some of the
  shields are much smaller than the others, sometimes mere vestiges in all stages of gradual
  suppression, and that the abnormalities are much more common in babies and small specimens than in
  adults. The importance of these "orthogenetic" variations has been discussed on <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page326">326</a></span>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Pleurodira.</b>&ndash;<i>Neck bending laterally and tucked away in the niche
  formed between the anterior portion of the carapace and plastron. Pelvis ankylosed to the shell,
  the broadened tops of the ilia to the carapace, the distal ends of the pubes and ischia to the
  plastron.</i></p>

  <p>Freshwater tortoises, almost entirely carnivorous, inhabiting South America, Australia, Africa,
  and Madagascar. Fossil forms are known from the Jurassic epoch onwards.</p>

  <p>Owing to the strong connexion of the iliac bones with the costal plates the sacrum has become
  practically abolished, the sacral ribs being reduced to one pair (the posterior of the original
  two pairs) or being absent. The centra of the cervical vertebrae articulate by cup and ball
  joints. The formation of the temporal region of the skull varies considerably in the three
  families, some genera lacking the complete zygomatic arch, while others have a narrow
  parieto-squamosal arch bridging over the temporal fossa, or the latter is completely roofed over
  by the laterally expanded parietal, which meets the jugal and quadrato-jugal. The quadrate is
  always trumpet-shaped; the rim of the tympanum is complete, but the posterior part of the trumpet
  remains open. The basisphenoid, pterygoids, and palatines form a broad and flat roof to the mouth.
  The vomer is large, and separates the palatines in the Chelydidae; it is very much <span
  class="pagenum" id="page389"><span class="smaller">{389}</span></span>reduced or absent in the
  Pelomedusidae, in which the palatines meet. All the Chelydidae, except <i>Chelys</i>, have nasal
  bones which remain distinct from the prefrontals. The choanae lie in front of the palatines,
  divided by the vomer when this is present, but they are not roofed in ventrally.</p>

  <p>The ilia are solidly ankylosed in the adult with the neighbouring costal plates, mostly with
  the last two pairs, sometimes also with the pygal plate. The lateral processes of the pubes fuse
  with the xiphiplastra. The ischia are also attached to the same plastral elements.</p>

  <p>The carapace is flat and completely ossified. The nuchal plate is always conspicuous, much
  larger than the neurals, and these are often reduced by being encroached upon by the eight pairs
  of costal plates, which then meet in the dorsal line. In <i>Sternothaerus</i> all the eight
  neurals are present and form a continuous row. In most of the other genera they are reduced to
  seven, the last being squeezed out. In <i>Rhinemys</i> they are reduced to the second, third and
  fourth and an isolated fifth, and in <i>Hydraspis</i> they are all gone. The pygal plate is
  always, even in <i>Sternothaerus</i>, separated from the last neural by the eighth pair of
  costals. The marginals number 23, but in <i>Carettochelys</i> only 21.</p>

  <p>The carapace is covered with horny shields, except in <i>Carettochelys</i>. The nuchal is
  absent in the Pelomedusidae and in a few Chelydidae (<i>Elseya</i> and a few species of
  <i>Emydura</i>). In <i>Hydromedusa</i> the nuchal is shut in by the anterior marginals, simulating
  a sixth neural. The plastron is composed of the usual nine elements, but the Pelomedusidae possess
  an additional pair, the meso-plastra, inserted between the hyo- and hypo-plastra. The bridge is
  strong, connected with the carapace by suture. In <i>Sternothaerus</i> the front lobe of the
  plastron is movable. The intergular shield is always present; it is terminal, forming part of the
  front margin, except in <i>Chelodina</i>, where this shield, although large, is shut in behind the
  gulars (cf. Fig. 61, <span class="smaller">4</span> and <span class="smaller">5</span>, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page315">315</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Although the Pleurodira are a peculiarly specialised group, one of the oldest Chelonian fossils
  known seems to belong to them. <i>Proganochelys</i>, represented by a complete shell, nearly 2
  feet long, has been found in the Upper Keuper Sandstone of W&uuml;rtemberg. <i>Plesiochelys</i>, of the
  Upper Jurassic of Switzerland, has eight neural and three supracaudal plates, but is without the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page390"><span class="smaller">{390}</span></span>ischiadic plastral
  ankylosis. <i>Pleurosternum</i>, of the English and Continental Purbeck beds, has meso-plastral
  plates like the recent Pelomedusidae. <i>Rhinochelys</i>, of the Cambridge Greensand, has a broad
  parieto-postfrontal roof, and large nasal bones. Forms like <i>Podocnemis</i>, now restricted to
  South America, occur in the Eocene of Europe. One of the most aberrant Chelonians is
  <i>Miolania</i>, from the Plistocene of Queensland and from Lord Howe's Island, remarkable for its
  huge size and the thick armour on the head and tail; the head especially carries large paired
  projections, one pair of which extends horizontally like powerful horns, recalling the queer
  Theromorphous <i>Elginia</i>.</p>

  <p>We divide the recent Pleurodira into three families, of which that of <i>Carettochelys</i>
  stands apart by its paddle-shaped limbs and the absence of horny shields. The Pelomedusidae and
  Chelydidae are closely allied. The former are not Australian, and are externally distinguished by
  the absence of a nuchal shield.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pelomedusidae.</b>&ndash;Neck completely retractile within the shell. Carapace
  without a nuchal shield. The plastron is composed of eleven plates, there being besides the
  unpaired endo-plastron a pair of meso-plastra, situated between the hyo- and hypo-plastra; but
  these meso-plastra meet in the middle line in <i>Sternothaerus</i> only, while in
  <i>Podocnemis</i> and <i>Pelomedusa</i> they are restricted to small pieces on the bridge, widely
  separated from each other by the usual hyo- and hypo-plastral suture. A nuchal shield is absent;
  there are twenty-four marginal and thirteen plastral shields, inclusive of the conspicuous
  intergular. The temporal fossa is widely open, except in <i>Podocnemis</i>, where it is partly
  roofed in by the meeting of the much-expanded quadrato-jugal with the parietal. The palatine bones
  are in median contact, not separated by the vomer. Nasal bones being absent, the large prefrontals
  meet in the middle line. The second cervical vertebra is biconvex.</p>

  <p>This family is now represented by only three genera, with about fifteen species in Africa,
  Madagascar, and South America.</p>

  <p><i>Sternothaerus.</i>&ndash;Skull without a bony supratemporal roof. Meso-plastra large,
  extending right across the plastron. Anterior lobe of the plastron movable, the hinge passing
  between the hyo- and meso-plastral plates, and between the pectoral and abdominal shields. Fore-
  and hind-limbs with five short digits and claws. Several species in tropical and southern Africa,
  and <span class="pagenum" id="page391"><span class="smaller">{391}</span></span>in Madagascar.
  <i>S. derbianus</i> in West Africa, from the Gambia to Angola, is the largest species, with a
  shell nearly one foot in length.</p>

  <p><i>Pelomedusa.</i>&ndash;Skull with a slender parieto-squamosal arch. Meso-plastra small and
  lateral. Plastron without a hinge. Fore- and hind-limbs with five very short digits and five
  claws. Top of the head with one pair of shields between the eyes, and with a large interparietal
  and a pair of parietals behind.</p>

  <p><i>P. galeata</i>, the only species, occurs in Madagascar and nearly the whole of Africa south
  of the Sahara, from the Cape to Abyssinia, and in the Sinaitic peninsula. The shell, less than one
  foot in length, is much depressed and is obtusely keeled; brown above with black spots;
  brownish-yellow below. The short and broad head is coloured like the rest, without ornamentation.
  In Somaliland this species sleeps hidden on land during the dry seasons, from July to the end of
  September, and from January to March, and appears at once after the rains have set in.</p>

  <p><i>Podocnemis.</i>&ndash;With a supratemporal roof formed by the junction of the parietal with
  the quadrato-jugal. Meso-plastra small and lateral. Fore- and hind-limbs broadly webbed, with five
  and four claws respectively. The fore-arms and the outer edges of the hind-feet with several
  conspicuous shields, hence the generic name. Head with an interparietal, two parietals, and a
  narrow unpaired shield between the eyes. The tail is very short. The carapace is flat and broad,
  strongly serrated on the posterior margin. Chin with one or two short barbels. Several species in
  South America, chiefly in the basin of the Amazon, and one in Madagascar.</p>

  <p><i>P. expansa.</i>&ndash;Very common in Tropical South America, east of the Andes. The female,
  which is much larger than the male, has a shell nearly three feet in length. Olive-brown above
  with darker patches; yellowish below. With a few yellow spots above and behind the eyes, and on
  the parietal region. The "Arrau" turtle is of great commercial importance on account of the eggs,
  which are periodically collected in enormous quantities, chiefly for the oil. This is either
  eaten, like the eggs themselves, or used for burning in lamps, or as an addition to tar. The
  turtles are likewise eaten by man and beast. Thousands of the little creatures are snapped up by
  Jabiru storks, alligators, and fishes; the adults fall an easy prey <span class="pagenum"
  id="page392"><span class="smaller">{392}</span></span>to the prowling jaguar, which turns them
  over on to their backs and neatly cleans out the flesh with its sharp and powerful claws.</p>

  <p>Fertilisation takes place in the water, the eggs are deposited on land, in sand-banks, the
  female digging a hole about two feet deep and covering up the numerous soft-shelled eggs with
  sand. The time of deposition is the early hours of the morning, but the season depends upon the
  beginning of the principal rains, since the young are hatched shortly before the torrential rains.
  This season differs considerably in the various countries. The hatching takes about forty days;
  the eggs are consequently laid in the Amazon countries during the months of September to November,
  in the Orinoco district in March. This species lives in the pools of the inundated forests, and
  when these are dried up, the animals retire into the rivers themselves. Their food consists mainly
  of the fruit dropping down from the trees.</p>

  <p>Bates, in his delightful book, <i>The Naturalist on the River Amazon</i>, gives the following
  lively and exhaustive account of his experience with these turtles:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"I accompanied Cardozo in many wanderings on the Solimoes, during which we visited the 'praias'
  (sand islands), the turtle pools in the forests, and the by-streams and lakes of the great desert
  river. His object was mainly to superintend the business of digging up turtle eggs on the
  sandbanks, having been elected commandant for the year by the municipal council of Ega, of the
  'praia real' of Shimuni, the one lying nearest to Ega. There are four of these royal praias within
  the Ega district, a distance of 150 miles from the town, all of which are visited annually by the
  Ega people for the purpose of collecting eggs and extracting oil from their yolks. Each has its
  commander, whose business is to make arrangements for securing to every inhabitant an equal chance
  in the egg harvest, by placing sentinels to protect the turtles whilst laying, and so forth. The
  pregnant turtles descend from the interior pools to the main river in July and August, before the
  outlets dry up, and there seek in countless swarms their favourite sand-islands; for it is only a
  few praias that are selected by them out of the great number existing. The young animals remain in
  the pools throughout the dry season. These breeding places of turtles then lie 20 to 30 or more
  feet above the level of the river, <span class="pagenum" id="page393"><span
  class="smaller">{393}</span></span>and are accessible only by cutting roads through the dense
  forest....</p>

  <p>"We found the two sentinels lodged in a corner of the praia, where it commences at the foot of
  the towering forest-wall of the island, having built for themselves a little rancho with poles and
  palm-leaves. Great precautions are obliged to be taken to avoid disturbing the sensitive turtles,
  who, previous to crawling ashore to lay, assemble in great shoals off the sand-bank. The men,
  during this time, take care not to show themselves, and warn off any fisherman who wishes to pass
  near the place....</p>

  <p>"I rose from my hammock by daylight, shivering with cold; a praia, on account of the great
  radiation of heat in the night from the sand, being towards the dawn the coldest place that can be
  found in this climate. Cardozo and the men were already up watching the turtles. The sentinels had
  erected for this purpose a stage about fifty feet high, on a tall tree near their station, the
  ascent to which was by a roughly made ladder of woody lianas. They are enabled, by observing the
  turtles from their watch-tower, to ascertain the date of successive deposits of eggs, and thus
  guide the commandant in fixing the time for the general invitation to the Ega people.</p>

  <p>"The turtles lay their eggs by night, leaving the water, when nothing disturbs them, in vast
  crowds, and crawling to the central and highest part of the praia. These places are, of course,
  the last to go under water when, in unusually wet seasons, the river rises before the eggs are
  hatched by the heat of the sand.... The hours between midnight and dawn are the busiest. The
  turtles excavate with their broad webbed paws deep holes in the fine sand; the first-comer, in
  each case, making a pit about three feet deep, laying its eggs (about 120 in number), and covering
  them with sand; the next making its deposit at the top of that of its predecessor, and so on until
  every pit is full. The whole body of turtles frequenting a praia does not finish laying in less
  than fourteen or fifteen days, even when there is no interruption. When all have done, the area
  (called by the Brazilians 'taboleiro') over which they have excavated is distinguishable from the
  rest of the praia only by signs of the sand having been a little disturbed.</p>

  <p>"I mounted the sentinel's stage just in time to see the turtles retreating to the water on the
  opposite side of the sand-bank, <span class="pagenum" id="page394"><span
  class="smaller">{394}</span></span>after having laid their eggs. The sight was well worth the
  trouble of ascending the shaky ladder. They were about a mile off, but the surface of the sands
  was blackened with the multitudes which were waddling towards the river; the margin of the praia
  was rather steep, and they all seemed to tumble head first down the declivity into the water....
  Placards were posted up on the church doors at Ega, announcing that the excavation on Shimuni
  would commence on the 17th of October, and on Catu&aacute;, sixty miles below Shimuni, on the 25th. By
  the morning of the 17th some 400 persons were assembled on the borders of the sand-bank, each
  family having erected a rude temporary shed of poles and palm-leaves to protect themselves from
  the sun and rain. Large copper kettles to prepare the oil, and hundreds of red earthenware jars,
  were scattered about on the sand.</p>

  <p>"The excavation of the taboleiro, collecting the eggs, and purifying the oil, occupied four
  days. All was done on a system established by the old Portuguese governors, probably more than a
  century ago. The commandant first took down the names of all the masters of households, with the
  number of persons each intended to employ in digging; he then exacted a payment of 140 reis (about
  4d.) a head towards defraying the expense of sentinels. The whole were then allowed to go to the
  taboleiro. They ranged themselves round the circle, each person armed with a paddle, to be used as
  a spade, and then all began simultaneously to dig on a signal being given&ndash;the roll of
  drums&ndash;by order of the commandant. It was an animating sight to behold the wide circle of
  rival diggers throwing up clouds of sand in their energetic labours, and working gradually towards
  the centre of the ring. A little rest was taken during the great heat of mid-day, and in the
  evening the eggs were carried to the huts in baskets. By the end of the second day the taboleiro
  was exhausted; large mounds of eggs, some of them four to five feet in height, were then seen by
  the side of each hut, the produce of the labour of the family.</p>

  <p>"In the hurry of digging, some of the deeper nests are passed over; to find these out, the
  people go about provided with a long steel or wooden probe, the presence of the eggs being
  discoverable by the ease with which the spit enters the sand. When no more eggs are to be found,
  the mashing process begins. <span class="pagenum" id="page395"><span
  class="smaller">{395}</span></span>The egg, it may be here mentioned, has a flexible or leathery
  shell; it is quite round, and somewhat larger than a hen's egg. The whole heap is thrown into an
  empty canoe and mashed with wooden prongs; but sometimes naked Indians and children jump into the
  mass and tread it down, besmearing themselves with yolk, and making about as filthy a scene as can
  well be imagined. This being finished, water is poured into the canoe, and the fatty mass is then
  left for a few hours to be heated by the sun, on which the oil separates and rises to the surface.
  The floating oil is afterwards skimmed off with long spoons, made by tying large mussel-shells to
  the end of rods, and purified over the fire in copper kettles.</p>

  <p>"The destruction of turtle eggs every year by these proceedings is enormous. At least 6000
  jars, holding each three gallons of the oil, are exported annually from the Upper Amazons and the
  Madeira to Para, where it is used for lighting, frying fish, and other purposes. It may be fairly
  estimated that 2000 more jarfuls are consumed by the inhabitants of the villages on the river.
  Now, it takes twelve basketfuls of eggs, or about 6000, by the wasteful process followed, to make
  one jar of oil. The total number of eggs annually destroyed amounts, therefore, to 48 millions. As
  each turtle lays about 120, it follows that the yearly offspring of 400,000 turtles is thus
  annihilated. A vast number, nevertheless, remain undetected; and these would probably be
  sufficient to keep the turtle population of these rivers up to the mark, if the people did not
  follow the wasteful practice of lying in wait for the newly-hatched young, and collecting them by
  thousands for eating; their tender flesh, and the remains of yolk in their entrails, being
  considered a great delicacy. The chief natural enemies of the turtle are vultures and alligators,
  which devour the newly-hatched young as they descend in shoals to the water. These must have
  destroyed an immensely greater number before the European settlers began to appropriate the eggs
  than they do now. It is almost doubtful if this natural persecution did not act as effectively in
  checking the increase of the turtle as the artificial destruction now does. If we are to believe
  the tradition of the Indians, however, it had not this result; for they say that formerly the
  waters teemed as thickly with turtles as the air does now with mosquitoes. The universal <span
  class="pagenum" id="page396"><span class="smaller">{396}</span></span>opinion of the settlers on
  the Upper Amazon is, that the turtle has very greatly decreased in numbers, and is still annually
  decreasing.</p>

  <p>"The principal object of another expedition was to search certain pools in the forest for young
  turtle. We started from the praia at sunrise on the 7th of October in two canoes, containing
  twenty-three persons, nineteen of whom were Indians. The pool covered an area of about four or
  five acres, and was closely hemmed in by the forest, which, in picturesque variety and grouping of
  trees and foliage, exceeded almost everything I had yet witnessed. The margins for some distance
  were swampy, and covered with large tufts of fine grass. The pool was nowhere more than five feet
  deep, one foot of which was not water, but extremely fine and soft mud.</p>

  <p>"Cardozo and I spent an hour paddling about. The Indians seemed to think that netting the
  animals, as Cardozo proposed doing, was not lawful sport, and wished first to have an hour or
  two's old-fashioned practice with their weapons. I was astonished at the skill which they
  displayed in shooting turtles from little stages made of poles and cross pieces of wood. They did
  not wait for their coming to the surface to breathe, but watched for the slight movements in the
  water which revealed their presence underneath. These little tracts on the water are called the
  sirir&eacute;; the instant one was perceived an arrow flew from the bow of the nearest man, and never
  failed to pierce the shell of the submerged animal. When the turtle was very distant, of course
  the aim had to be taken at a considerable elevation, but the marksmen preferred a longish range,
  because the arrow then fell more perpendicularly on the shell, and entered it more deeply.</p>

  <p>"The arrow used in turtle-shooting has a strong lancet-shaped steel point fitted into a peg,
  which enters the tip of the shaft. The peg is secured to the shaft by twine, being some thirty or
  forty yards in length, and neatly wound round the body of the arrow. When the missile enters the
  shell the peg drops out, and the pierced animal descends with it towards the bottom, leaving the
  shaft floating on the surface. This being done the sportsman paddles in his canoe to the place,
  and gently draws the animal by the twine, humouring it by giving it the rein when it plunges,
  until it is brought again near the surface, when <span class="pagenum" id="page397"><span
  class="smaller">{397}</span></span>he strikes it with a second arrow. With the increased hold
  given by the two cords he has then no difficulty in landing his game.</p>

  <p>"By mid-day the men had shot about a score of nearly full-grown turtles. Cardozo then gave
  orders to spread the net.... Three boat loads, or about eighty, were secured in about twenty
  minutes. They were then taken ashore and each one secured by the men tying the legs with thongs of
  bast.</p>

  <p>"When the canoes had been twice filled we desisted after a very hard day's work. Nearly all the
  animals were young ones, chiefly, according to the statement of Pedro, from three to ten years of
  age; they varied from 6 to 18 inches in length, and were very fat. Cardozo and I lived almost
  exclusively on them for several months afterwards. Roasted in the shell they form a most
  appetising dish. These younger turtles never migrate with their elders on the sinking of the
  waters, but remain in the tepid pools, fattening on fallen fruits, and, according to the natives,
  on the fine nutritious mud. We captured a few full-grown mother turtles, which were known at once
  by the horny skin of their breast plates being worn, telling of their having crawled on the sand
  to lay eggs the previous year. They had evidently made a mistake in not leaving the pool at the
  proper time, for they were full of eggs, which, we were told, they would, before the season was
  over, scatter in despair over the swamp. We also found several male turtles, or capitaris, as they
  are called by the natives. These are immensely less numerous than the females, and are
  distinguishable by their much smaller size, more circular shape, and the greater length and
  thickness of their tails. Their flesh is considered unwholesome, especially to sick people having
  external signs of inflammation."</p>

  <p>The most recent account of these water tortoises is that published by Dr. Goeldi from the MS.
  of Jo&atilde;o Martins da Silva Continho, a former resident at Man&aacute;os on the Middle Amazon. The
  "Tartaruga" (the Portuguese name for turtles) live from January to July in the inundated, quiet
  backwaters of the forest-region, feeding upon the various seeds of palms as these ripen and drop
  successively; rarely, and only when hard up, they are carnivorous. The creatures hide under water
  below the trees, when they are espied by the Indians, who dive down to a depth of twenty and more
  feet to catch them in their arms. The <span class="pagenum" id="page398"><span
  class="smaller">{398}</span></span>civilised Indians use a steel-pointed lance of hard wood, about
  10 feet in length. A string connects the point with the shaft around which it is wound. When stuck
  into the tortoise the shaft and point part; the string is either tied to the boat or to a little
  float of light wood. In other districts an arrow with a string is employed.</p>

  <p>In August, when the water subsides, the tortoises return to the rivers, and the entrance of the
  lagoon is closed with nets. A number of boats with long poles drive them with much noise towards
  the entrance. On their way to the rivers the tortoises always go up-stream, and this is called the
  "arriba&ccedil;a&otilde; das tartarugas," the ascent of the turtles. The fishermen post themselves at shallow
  spots or on sand-banks, and wait for the creatures which come up to find a place for landing and
  laying. The arrows employed are called <i>sararaca</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a thing which can be
  disjointed; they are about 4 feet long, and consist of a <i>gomo</i> or internodium of wood 9
  inches long with a one- or two-barbed steel point, and the shaft into which the <i>gomo</i> fits
  loosely. The <i>gomo</i> is, moreover, connected with the shaft by a string made of palm-fibres
  about 30 feet in length, partly wound round the shaft, which ultimately acts as a float.</p>

  <p>The laying takes place from the end of September into October. Some of the parents seem to
  reconnoitre on land for a few days. As a rule only females do this, and the natives say that they
  are led by a "<i>mestra</i>." The laying takes place early in the morning. The number of females
  is so great that they often block the way of the boats, and make a great noise by knocking against
  their neighbours' shells. Each digs a hole about 18 inches or 2 feet deep, and lays from 80 to 200
  eggs. Sometimes the laying individual is entirely buried by its neighbours which are scraping
  their own holes.</p>

  <p>In some districts the eggs are wanted for "manteiga" (Portuguese for butter); and the turning
  over, or <i>vira&ccedil;a&otilde;</i> of the tortoises takes place later. In other districts they are caught
  before the eggs are laid, and this barbaric and destructive custom was formerly forbidden by the
  people themselves. Although the provincial assembly tried to reinstitute the old reasonable
  customs, the inspectors are often got over by bribery.</p>

  <p>There are two ways of extracting the oil from the eggs. To get the thick oil used, mixed with
  tar, for shipbuilding, caulking, <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span
  class="smaller">{399}</span></span>etc., the eggs are heaped up for five days and then worked. The
  fluid oil for lighting is made from fresh eggs, which are put into a boat and then trampled out
  with the feet. The oil is drawn off into large earthen jars and put on the fire. Then it is
  rapidly cooled. The best oil, used for frying fish, is that which is gained from the roasted
  tortoises themselves. Fresh eggs are either fried or taken with sugar, or mixed with manioca-flour
  and water. The young, which are hatched in January, are likewise eaten fried, or they are
  preserved in the fat of the parents.</p>

  <p>An average tortoise yields 5 lbs. of fat, costing on the spot two milreis. The whole full-grown
  animal, of one yard in length, costs the same, and its meat is sufficient to sustain a family of
  six people for three days. To make 24 lbs. of oil requires 3000 eggs. Two or three tortoises would
  yield the same amount from their fat. Consequently the destruction of the eggs causes an enormous
  waste, and is after all the least economical procedure. In the year 1719, 192,000 lbs. were
  exported from the Alto Amazonas, representing 24,000,000 eggs. In 1700 there were still plenty of
  tortoises 50 leagues above the mouth of the Para river. Now there is no assembly of more than
  fifteen tortoises to be found anywhere within 300 leagues from Para to the mouth of the Rio Negro.
  On the Rio Madeira, from the mouth to the first cataract, 186 leagues distance, there are now only
  two regular nesting localities. The upper Solimoes and the Rio Yapura are still rich. Near Ega are
  regular tortoise-ponds, called "curral," which yield sufficient support to their owners; the
  animals are fed with manioca-flour and leguminous plants.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Chelydidae.</b>&ndash;The neck bends under the margin of the carapace, but remains
  partly exposed. The nuchal shield is absent except in two Northern Australian species. There are
  twelve pairs of marginal shields. The plastron is composed of nine plates, and is covered with
  thirteen shields, one of which is the conspicuous intergular. The temporal region of the skull
  shows great diversity. It is quite open in <i>Chelodina</i>, covered in by broad expansions of the
  parietal bones in <i>Platemys</i>, <i>Emydura</i>, and <i>Elseya</i>, or bridged over by a
  parieto-squamosal arch, which is very slender in <i>Rhinemys</i>, strong in <i>Chelys</i> and
  <i>Hydraspis</i>. The palatine bones are separated by the vomer; the nasals are variable, mostly
  present, but the prefrontals are always small, and separated <span class="pagenum"
  id="page400"><span class="smaller">{400}</span></span>by the frontals.  The fifth and eighth
  cervical vertebrae are biconvex.</p>

  <p>This family, still represented by nearly thirty species, which are divided into eight genera,
  is restricted to Notogaea, namely, South America and Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Chelys fimbriata</i>, the "Matamata," the only species of this genus, inhabits the rivers of
  Guiana and Northern Brazil. Besides the nuchal, there are seven neural plates; the last pair of
  costals form a median suture. Nasal bones are absent. The jaws are very weak. The Matamata has a
  very peculiar appearance. The nose is produced into a long, soft tube, at the end of which open
  the tiny nostrils. The eyes are very small, and the orbits are placed very near the anterior end
  of the skull, while the parietal <span class="pagenum" id="page401"><span
  class="smaller">{401}</span></span>region is broad and much elongated (Fig. 87, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page400">400</a></span>). The quadrates are drawn out into trumpet-shaped
  tubes. The hyoid apparatus is very large, with enormous anterior and posterior horns. The head and
  neck are as long as or even longer than the carapace, which is covered with thick, lumpy shields.
  The skin of the thick neck, of the sides and under parts of the head, is produced into many soft
  arborescent excrescences or fimbriae, those of the chin and throat and the large ear-flaps being
  movable at will, and probably used to attract fishes and other prey. The tail is very short. The
  fore- and hind-limbs are webbed, the former with five, the latter with four claws. Old specimens,
  which reach a total length of three feet, are uniformly dark brown, and look like a log covered
  with rough bark. The young are far less ugly, with black and yellow spots on the shell, and with
  dark stripes along the neck.</p>

  <p>Very little is known about the habits of this peculiar creature. It is said to lie submerged in
  the water, waiting for fishes, frogs, or tadpoles, which are attracted by the playing motions of
  its cutaneous excrescences. The jaws being so weak, and being covered with a partly soft lip-like
  skin, it is probable that they are not used for seizing the prey, but that the latter is engulfed
  into the mouth with the inrush of water into the throat. <span class="pagenum" id="page402"><span
  class="smaller">{402}</span></span>That this can be widened enormously is indicated by the greatly
  developed hyoid apparatus.</p>

  <p><i>Chelodina.</i>&ndash;The neck is long and slender, the head small and smooth. The nuchal is
  terminal; the intergular is large. The neural plates are completely suppressed, all the eight
  pairs of costal plates meeting in the middle line. The shell is very flat. Anterior and posterior
  limbs entirely webbed, and with only four claws. The tail is very short. Three species in
  Australia, one in New Guinea.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. longicollis</i> reaches a shell-length of ten inches. It inhabits Southern Australia.
  The illustrations make a detailed description unnecessary. The colour of the dorsal shield is
  uniformly dark rich brown, while the shields of the under surface are yellow, with broad dark
  brown lines along the sutures. These "long-necked Chelodines" have a striking appearance, when
  they swim or creep about, with the neck either stretched out straight or bent horizontally in an
  <span class="sans fwb">S</span>-shape. The whole creature looks neat and elegant; the iris is pale
  yellow, and gives the eye a very intelligent expression. They keep well in captivity, provided
  they are given the choice of land and water. My own prefer to spend most of the day on land,
  preferably under the ledge of a stone, or perched upon the stone itself if the latter is in the
  shade, and not too much exposed to view. There they lie motionless, with the neck neatly tucked
  under the shell, either to the right or to the left. Although the eyelids may be closed, they can
  see well enough, owing to the transparent condition of the lower lid. They feed in the water upon
  soft animals, as for instance worms, smooth caterpillars, cockroaches or little frogs; and they
  also take meat readily, provided this is moved about. The food is invariably taken with a quick
  sideward jerk of the neck and head.</p>

  <p>My specimens soon became so tame that they left the water, and ran up to me with the necks
  stretched to their full length, then snatching the bit of food, and retiring into the pond to
  swallow it. When left to themselves they are rather nocturnal in their feeding habits. Now and
  then they tuck themselves away for weeks without feeding, for instance when they go through a
  regular term of <span class="pagenum" id="page404"><span
  class="smaller">{404}</span></span>aestivation in the summer. The last winter they spent buried in
  the moss, but occasionally, especially on bright and sunny days, they went into the water for a
  few hours, chiefly to drink, but sometimes also to take a little food.</p>

  <p><i>Hydromedusa</i>, a South American genus, has a neck even longer than that of
  <i>Chelodina</i>, which it much resembles externally. But the nuchal shield, large and broad
  transversely, is situated behind the anterior marginals, looking therefore like a sixth neural
  shield. The neural plates form a continuous row, only the last pair of costal plates meeting in
  the middle line. <i>H. tectifera</i> occurs in Southern Brazil, and in the La Plata. The shell is
  dark brown above; yellowish, with dark spots, below; the head and neck are olive-coloured, adorned
  with a broad white, black-edged band on either side. Fore- and hind-limbs broadly webbed, and with
  four claws. Total length of the shell about eight inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Carettochelydidae.</b>&ndash;The shell is covered with soft skin instead of horny
  shields. The limbs are transformed into paddles, with elongated digits, and have only two claws.
  The neck is short, and not retractile. In other respects the skeleton, notably the plastron,
  pelvis, and skull, conform with the Pleurodirous type. Only one species, <i>Carettochelys
  insculpta</i>, still imperfectly known, from the Fly River, New Guinea. Length of the shell of the
  only complete specimen about 18 inches. This peculiar creature seems to stand in the same relation
  to the typical Pleurodira, as do the Chelonidae to the Testudinidae, except for the complete
  reduction of the horny shields upon the shell, recalling in this respect <i>Sphargis</i> and
  <i>Trionyx</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 3. Trionychoidea.</b>&ndash;The shell is very flat, oval, or almost round, and is
  covered with soft, leathery skin instead of with horny shields. The limbs are broadly webbed, and
  only the three inner digits are provided with claws. Carnivorous, found in the rivers of Asia,
  Africa, and North America.</p>

  <p>The head and neck are completely retractile, bending by a sigmoid curve in a vertical plane
  like that of the Cryptodira. The jaws are concealed by soft, lip-like flaps, and the nose forms a
  soft short proboscis. The ear is hidden. The skull, Fig. 91, is flat, with three long posterior
  processes, formed by the supra-occipital above, and the squamosals on either side. The whole
  temporal region forms a wide, shallow fossa, without any <span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span
  class="smaller">{405}</span></span>indication of being arched or bridged over. The premaxilla is
  extremely small, unpaired, not even reaching the nasal cavity or the vomer. The maxillaries are
  correspondingly enlarged, surrounding the choanae, which are separated by the narrow vomer. The
  palatines form a median suture, and are joined behind by the long basisphenoid, which separates
  the long pterygoids from each other. The quadrate is trumpet-shaped, with a posterior notch for
  the stapes. The zygomatic arch is complete, and is formed by the quadrato-jugal and the jugal; the
  latter joins the maxillary and postfrontal, mostly reaching the orbit; in some cases it also just
  meets the parietal, thereby adding to the strength of the postorbital arch. The prefrontals are
  large; nasals are absent. The mandible is remarkable for the great development of the coronoid
  process.</p>

  <p>The pubic and ischiadic bones enclose a large heart-shaped foramen, and are free from the
  plastron; the ilia are attached only to the sacral ribs. The carapace is peculiar in so far as it
  is very incomplete peripherally, the ribs extending considerably beyond the costal plates, nor are
  they joined by marginal plates, which are absent, unless they are represented by a few small
  ossifications imbedded in the posterior marginal flap of the disc (<i>Emyda</i> of India). The rim
  of the disc is always formed by a horizontal, cutaneous, very flexible flap. All the dorsal plates
  have a rough upper surface, vermiculated or rugose, as usual with such dermal bones, which have
  lost most of or all their horny covering, and have sunk more deeply into the skin. The <span
  class="pagenum" id="page406"><span class="smaller">{406}</span></span>nuchal plate has usually a
  pair of rib-like processes. The neurals form a continuous series, except in the African
  <i>Cyclanorbis</i>, in which they are much reduced in size, and separated by the costal
  plates.</p>

  <p>The plastron is imperfect, all its constituent nine elements being only loosely connected with
  each other, and there remains a wide median vacuity between the lateral elements. Most of these
  plastral bones are reduced to splints, which, instead of meeting by regular sutures, loosely
  interdigitate with their jagged edges. In the young all these ventral elements are deeply imbedded
  in the soft, leathery skin, and they do not at all resemble in appearance those of the dorsal
  side. With age they develop upon their ventral surface stronger and denser ossifications, which
  ultimately broaden out, sometimes beyond the original underlying bone, and assume the
  characteristic vermiculated surface-appearance. This is undoubtedly a process of exostosis, a step
  towards revival of that armour which had been much reduced ancestrally. To appreciate this
  condition, it is at least suggestive that these mud-tortoises, when kept in the usual
  hard-bottomed tanks, invariably become sore, the skin wearing through where the imbedded plastral
  bones touch the ground. Thus what is crammed into the short life of a captive individual, is in
  the natural course of events spread over many generations, whereby it has ceased to be
  pathological, and has become a comparatively new, tertiary, but regular feature.</p>

  <p>It is not open to much doubt that the characteristic features of the Trionychoidea are not
  primitive but secondary. This is indicated by the whole structure and behaviour of the carapace
  and plastron. The softening of the whole shell, the loss of the horny shields, the reduction of
  the claws, are the direct and almost unavoidable results of life in muddy waters.</p>

  <p>Geologically they do not seem to be very old. They appear, already referable to the genus
  <i>Trionyx</i>, in the Upper Cretaceous strata of North America. In the Lower and Middle Tertiary
  strata many species existed in North America and in Europe, and it is of great importance that in
  these species the costal plates were much broader, and the marginal plates better developed, than
  in the recent forms. Now their half-dozen genera, with about twenty-four species, are confined to
  North America, the tropical and warmer parts of Asia, and the Malay <span class="pagenum"
  id="page407"><span class="smaller">{407}</span></span>Islands, and to Africa from the Nile to the
  Senegal and to the Congo.</p>

  <p>The habits of Trionychoidea have found few observers. According to L. Agassiz,<a id="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> they live in the muddy bottom of shallow waters, burying
  themselves in the soft mud, with only the head, or a small part of it, exposed. They breathe
  without moving the body, by raising up the long neck and carrying the leathery snout above water.
  When moving through the water they strike horizontally with both pairs of limbs, alternating,
  however, the right and left; but when they start suddenly, the front limbs are seen moving
  together towards the tip of the snout, and then striking simultaneously backward with great power.
  As the shield does not project forward, the fore-limbs usually move beyond the shield, and as its
  outer edge is sharp, and the feet are broad, their webs reach above as well as below the plane of
  that edge, so that the water is driven partly over and partly under it. When they move along the
  bottom, the limbs still move horizontally, the webs striking against the water, and the inner
  toes, those with the claws, against the bottom. They also bury themselves horizontally, becoming
  covered by only a thin layer of mud. They readily resort to the shell for protection. The neck and
  head are withdrawn entirely, the loose skin rolling off from the greater part of the neck; and the
  skin of the legs also slips off, as far as the elbows and knees. In confinement they exhibit great
  quickness; their movements are abrupt and unsteady, except when they swim rapidly in one
  direction. They then dart their long and slender neck quickly forwards or sideways and upwards, as
  snakes do, and bite in the same way, striking suddenly. Their temper is bad or even ferocious, and
  large specimens are quite dangerous.</p>

  <p>Their food consists of all sorts of aquatic animals, fish, frogs, and molluscs, for instance
  <i>Anodonta</i> and <i>Paludina</i>. According to the different diet, many species develop a
  peculiar kind of dimorphism, a reasonable explanation of which has been given by Boulenger. In the
  young the horny coverings of the jaws are sharp, with cutting edges, and in those specimens which
  keep to a diet of fish and other soft creatures, the jaws remain in the same condition. But in
  those which take to living upon molluscs, the hard shells of which they have to crush, the horny
  edges are <span class="pagenum" id="page408"><span class="smaller">{408}</span></span>worn down;
  and broad, thick, horny, crushing pads are developed in their stead, the supporting parts of the
  jaws becoming more massive. The masticatory muscles are likewise enlarged, and a tubercle grows
  upon the lower border of the jugal bone, whence arises part of the masseter muscle.</p>

  <p>The eggs are round, thick-shelled, but very brittle; they are laid in the sand above the level
  of the water, and this is the chief occasion on which these tortoises creep on land.</p>

  <p><i>Trionyx.</i>&ndash;The plastron has no special cutaneous valves for the concealment of the
  hind-limbs. This is the principal genus, with the greatest number of species and the widest
  distribution, the latter coinciding with that of the whole family. The upper surface of the shell
  of young specimens frequently forms numerous longitudinal ridges or series of little horny
  tubercles which disappear with age.</p>

  <p><i>T. ferox</i>, the commonest "Soft-shelled Turtle" of the United States. Olive above with
  scattered, small, round, black spots; young with conical, spine-like tubercles, especially on the
  nuchal border and on the posterior portion of the shell, which has a pale, black-edged border. A
  light, black-edged streak passes through the eye and joins its fellow on the snout. The limbs are
  olive brown, spotted and marbled with black. The under parts of the shell are white. Very large
  specimens have a shell 18 inches in length and 16 inches wide. Holbrook gives the following
  account of its habits:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"A voracious, carnivorous creature. They reside most constantly in the water, swim with
  rapidity, and choose for their retreat holes under the banks of rivers, or under rocks; and not
  unfrequently the trunk of some huge forest tree, fallen into the stream, affords them shelter.
  Sometimes they leave the water and conceal themselves in the mud: I have frequently seen them thus
  buried to the depth of 2 or 3 inches, leaving only a small breathing hole for the long neck and
  narrow head, which is occasionally thrust out, but most commonly it is retracted so that one would
  pass near without observing their habitation; and if seen, it might easily be mistaken for the
  residence of some large insect. At other times they may be seen in numbers on rocks in shallow
  water, basking in the sun, apparently asleep. They bite severely when provoked, darting forward
  with great velocity the long neck and head, and not unfrequently spring upward at the same time
  and make a loud hiss.</p>

  <p>In the month of May the females seek sandy places along the banks of the waters they inhabit to
  lay their eggs, generally about sixty in number; and it is remarkable that, though their motions
  are slow and difficult on dry land, yet at this season they sometimes mount hillocks several feet
  high. The flesh affords the most delicate food, surpassing that even of the Green Turtle. The
  geographical distribution is interesting. It inhabits the Savannah as well as all those rivers
  that empty into the northern borders of the Gulf of Mexico; it ascends up the broad Mississippi,
  and is found in all its tributaries, even to the very foot of the Rocky Mountains; it abounds in
  the chain of great northern lakes both above and below the Falls of Niagara, and is common in the
  Mohawk, a tributary of the <span class="pagenum" id="page410"><span

    <p class="sp0"><i>Mesozoic, long-tailed, toothed reptiles, with distal ischiadic symphysis,
    terrestrial limbs, large fixed quadrate bones and bifurcated ribs.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Dinosaurs begin and end with the Mesozoic epoch, and have a world-wide distribution. The
  name, "terrible Reptiles," refers to the gigantic proportions which many of them attained, not a
  few of them surpassing in size and shape the fantastic pictures of the dragons of our fables.
  Although these creatures came to an end millions of years before the first man-like beings
  appeared, it is reasonable to suppose that the widely-spread myths of dragons are based upon the
  accidentally disclosed skeletons of these monsters.</p>

  <p>The skull is built after a plan which may be derived from a combination of the Crocodilian and
  Rhynchocephalian skulls, but the detail varies considerably in the many and much diversified
  members of this large sub-class. There is as a rule a pre-orbital foramen, which is smallest in
  the Ornithopoda. The orbit is completely encircled by bones, and the temporal fossa is divided by
  a squamoso-postfrontal or post-orbital bridge into a smaller supra-, and a much wider
  infra-temporal portion, the latter being bordered below by the jugal and quadrato-jugal, and this
  is firmly connected with the quadrate by an ascending process. The quadrate is long, more or less
  vertical in position, slanting either forwards or backwards, and firmly fixed above by the
  squamosal, perhaps also by a supra-temporal bone. The orbit is bordered by the jugal, lacrymal,
  pre- and post-frontals. The interparietal foramen seems to be <span class="pagenum"
  id="page413"><span class="smaller">{413}</span></span>abolished. Teeth, mostly alveolar and
  laterally compressed, are restricted to the dentary, maxillary, and premaxillary bones. In the
  Orthopoda the latter carry no teeth, or these are restricted to the lateral portion, leaving a
  wide diastema. This toothless part plays upon a peculiar crescent-shaped bone, the so-called
  predentary, which rests loosely upon the anterior ends of the mandibular rami, which latter do not
  as a rule form an osseous symphysis. The Ceratopsia possess in addition a similar upper toothless
  piece, the prerostral, a kind of pre-premaxilla. The morphological value of these extra pieces is
  quite obscure; they were in all probability provided with thick, horny pads. The bones of the roof
  of the mouth recall in their arrangement that prevailing in the Rhynchocephalia and the
  Parasuchia. There are two pairs of large vacuities; one between the maxillae, ectopterygoids and
  palatines; the other between the latter, the maxillae and the usually small or slender vomers. The
  pterygoids are perhaps the largest bones, and form a rather long symphysis; laterally and behind
  they abut against the quadrate, anteriorly against the ectopterygoids and the palatines, which
  latter they sometimes separate. A peculiar feature of some skulls, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
  and <i>Triceratops</i> is the great size of the groove in which the large hypophysis of the brain
  is lodged.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are very variable, amphicoelous, opisthocoelous, nearly plain, with a slight
  concavity behind, or occasionally procoelous in the anterior region of the tail. Besides the usual
  pre- and post-zygapophyses many Sauropoda and Theropoda possess on the posterior trunk-vertebrae
  additional joints, effected by a vertical wedge, the hyposphene, which extends backwards from
  between the post-zygapophyses and fits into a notch between and below the anterior zygapophyses of
  the next following vertebra. These additional articulations are analogous to the zygosphenes and
  zygantra of snakes and iguanas, except that in these Sauria the wedges are formed on the opposite,
  namely the anterior ends of the vertebrae. The vertebrae of the neck and trunk are devoid of
  intercentra, but those of the tail carry long chevron-bones. The number of sacral vertebrae is
  generally increased to four or five. The ribs have well-developed capitula and tubercula, and the
  former have the tendency to shift from the centra or from their parapophysial processes on to the
  usually much elongated diapophyses of the neural arches. This <span class="pagenum"
  id="page414"><span class="smaller">{414}</span></span>arrangement, recalling the Crocodilian
  condition, results in an increased capacity of the dorsal portion of the body-cavity.
  Intervertebral articulation of the ribs does not occur except sometimes in the sacral region.
  Abdominal ribs are rare, but they occur in some of the Theropoda, <i>e.g.</i> in
  <i>Compsognathus</i>.</p>

  <p>The sternum seems to have been mainly cartilaginous, with a pair of irregular, disc-shaped
  ossifications. How the coracoids were attached is unknown; they are small, generally with a
  foramen, but the scapulae are always very strong and slant backwards. Clavicles and interclavicles
  seem to be absent.</p>

  <p>The fore-limbs are as a rule powerful, although often much shorter than the hind-limbs, which
  are then enormously developed, and in many genera of two of the main groups show a tendency
  towards a semi-erect gait. Some of the Dinosaurs, e.g. <i>Iguanodon</i> and <i>Brontozoum</i>,
  were absolutely bipedal. Others seem to have hopped like Kangaroos. In correlation with this more
  or less erect mode of progression the iliac bones are very strong, much elongated horizontally,
  and attached to more than three, often to five or even more, vertebrae. The pubic bones show two
  main types. Each consists either of a single strong shaft, which is connected distally with its
  fellow; or (Orthopoda) this main shaft sends out, below its point of contact with the ischium, a
  long process, the so-called post-pubis, which is directed downwards and backwards. In the latter
  case it runs parallel and in close contact with the ischium. Such bifurcated pubic bones never
  meet in the middle line. The ischia, on the other hand, are always connected with each other, not
  so much by fusion as by syndesmosis.</p>

  <p>The hind-limbs exhibit all stages from a simple, plantigrade and five-toed state to a decidedly
  digitigrade, four, and even three-toed arrangement. Many genera exhibit the tendency to form an
  intertarsal joint, a feature elsewhere known in birds only, where it is typical and universal. The
  astragalus sends up an ascending process which tends to fuse with the anterior aspect of the
  distal end of the tibia, and the calcaneum is sometimes more or less firmly attached to the
  fibula. In <i>Compsognathus</i> even the distal tarsalia have begun to fuse with the metatarsalia,
  so that this reptile at least has a typical intertarsal joint. The femur is remarkable for the
  frequent possession of a "fourth" trochanter on the middle of the inner aspect of the shaft,
  undoubtedly <span class="pagenum" id="page415"><span class="smaller">{415}</span></span>for the
  insertion of the long caudi-femoral or long adductor muscle.</p>

  <p>Many Dinosaurs possess hollow instead of solid bones. The vertebrae have large cavities in the
  Sauropoda, notably in <i>Brontosaurus</i>; in many Theropoda, e.g. <i>Coelurus</i>,
  <i>Anchisaurus</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i>, the limb-bones and the vertebrae are hollow, the latter
  being reduced to thin-walled shells with a few inner partitions, the bones being at the same time
  much swollen and enlarged. In the Ornithopoda the vertebrae are solid, but the limb-bones are
  hollow. The reason of this hollowing out is not easily found. Undoubtedly it results in a saving
  of material and weight, whilst at the same time, without loss of strength, the surfaces for the
  attachment of the necessarily powerful muscles are increased. But <i>Compsognathus</i> is a small,
  <i>Brontozoum</i> a gigantic, creature. On the other hand, the bones of the huge Stegosauri are
  solid. Most probably these cavities were, as in birds, filled with air-sacs ultimately in
  communication with the lungs; and it is by no means a baseless suggestion of Haeckel's that the
  Dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Their mode of propagation can only be guessed at from the
  circumstance that a rather well-preserved specimen of <i>Compsognathus</i> contains in its abdomen
  what may possibly be an embryo. There is nothing against the assumption that the Dinosaurs were
  viviparous; on the contrary, it seems more natural than that, for instance, an
  <i>Atlantosaurus</i> of more than 100 feet in length and many tons in weight, should have laid
  eggs.</p>

  <p>Some of the herbivorous Dinosaurs, namely, the Stegosauri and the Ceratopsia, had a dermal
  armour of variable extent; the plates were loosely imbedded in the skin, and reached their
  greatest size along the middle of the back and tail, and these crested plates were probably
  covered with horny scutes, obviously weapons of defence. The Ceratopsia were armed with a pair of
  huge pointed horns on the head, and a smaller one on the nose (see Fig. 102, <span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page430">430</a></span>). It is difficult to guess the use of the weapons of these
  terrestrial monsters, unless they were employed against the equally large carnivorous Dinosaurs or
  in the combats for the possession of their charming mates.</p>

  <p>About the ancestry of the Dinosaurs we know nothing except that their affinities lie with the
  Crocodilia; but it is impossible to derive either from the other. The oldest forms, in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page416"><span class="smaller">{416}</span></span>present state of our
  knowledge&ndash;those which have left their three-toed spoors in the Trias of
  Connecticut&ndash;were already much specialised by having attained to an upright bipedal gait,
  while the Sauropoda, which except for their gigantic size are the most generalised, are of
  comparatively recent date, none of them being known from strata older than the Upper Jurassic.
  Twenty years ago, until the discoveries of numerous kinds in the United States, our knowledge of
  the whole group was very limited. There is a widely spread notion that the birds have sprung from
  some Dinosaurian stock. Huxley was the first to show clearly that birds were an offshoot of the
  reptiles, and he said of the Dinosaurs, especially his Ornithoscelida (<i>Iguanodon</i>,
  <i>Scelidosaurus</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i>, and others), that they "present a
  large series of modifications intermediate in structure between existing reptiles and Aves." Baur
  proved to his own satisfaction that we have to look for the ancestors of the Ratitae among the
  herbivorous Dinosaurs, especially the Ornithopodous forms, whilst the Carinatae are descendants of
  the Ratitae. However, even he had to give up this absolutely unwarrantable view.</p>

  <p>It is easy to select a considerable number of characters amongst the various Dinosaurs which
  also occur in birds, and some of these have until a recent date been considered as peculiar to
  birds. For instance, the double, bifurcated pubic bones of the Orthopoda; the increased number of
  vertebrae to which the horizontally elongated ilia are attached, especially in the forms with an
  upright gait, and the bipedal feature itself; the possession of an ascending process of the
  astragalus and its fusion with the tibia in <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Ceratosaurus</i> among the
  Theropoda, and in <i>Ornithomimus</i>; the attachment of the distal tarsalia to the metatarsalia,
  <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Compsognathus</i>,&ndash;in fact, the formation of an intertarsal joint, a
  feature otherwise characteristic of, and peculiar to, birds; the frequent reduction of the fifth
  metatarsal bone; the backward position of the hallux and the proximal reduction of its metatarsal
  in <i>Compsognathus</i>; the elongation and partial fusion of the functional metatarsals in the
  latter genus and in <i>Ceratosaurus</i>; the regular increase of the phalangeal numbers of the
  first four toes from two to five in many of the Ornithopoda;&ndash;in short, the great resemblance
  between the feet of some of the Dinosaurs and those of the birds. However striking these arguments
  are, they are instances of <span class="pagenum" id="page417"><span
  class="smaller">{417}</span></span>convergent analogies. The upright walk, which has been assumed
  and improved upon independently by members of both Theropoda and Orthopoda, has produced the same,
  or nearly the same modifications in them as in the birds.</p>

  <p>It is easy to show that these features are mere coincidences. The oldest bird known is
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> from the Upper Oolite of Bavaria. Consequently all those Dinosaurs, which are
  of the same and of later date, have to be excluded from the supposed ancestry, and they happen to
  be those in which (as in <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Ornithomimus</i>,
  <i>Iguanodon</i>) the resemblances are greatest. There remains only <i>Anchisaurus</i> of the
  Upper Trias, more or less contemporary with the <i>Brontozoum</i>, which left its three-toed
  footprints (<i>Archaeopteryx</i> has four well-developed toes) with <i>Zanclodon</i>. Moreover,
  the most bird-like foot is either that of the Theropoda, which, like <i>Anchisaurus</i> and
  <i>Zanclodon</i>, differ from birds by the formation of the pelvis, or of some of the latest
  Ornithopoda. What, then, is the good of selecting a number of bird-like features from members of
  Dinosaurs which we are bound to class in different groups, and which existed, some in the lower,
  others in the middle, or even in the latest Mesozoic periods?</p>

  <p>Lastly, the advocates of the Dinosaurian ancestry of birds cannot have fully appreciated the
  enormous differences between the wing of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the fore-limb of any Dinosaur
  with the most avian resemblances in the hind-limbs. The fore-limbs of these reptiles are modified
  in a direction diametrically opposed to that from which a bird-like wing could be developed. The
  skull presents another difficulty,and here again <i>Compsognathus</i>, a contemporary of
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, comes perhaps nearest to that of a generalised bird's skull. The ancestors
  of the birds must have combined the following characters:&ndash;Of not later than Mid-Oolitic age,
  with bifurcated pubic bones, four functional toes, elongated metatarsals, complete clavicles,
  premaxillary teeth, and free, not firmly fixed quadrate bones. But such creatures are not
  Dinosaurs.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We divide the enormous number of Dinosaurs according to the formation of the
  pelvis, that of the hind-limbs, and the dentition, into four orders.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page418"><span class="smaller">{418}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. SAUROPODA.</b></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pubes simple, with symphysis. Premaxillae with teeth. Plantigrade.</i></p>

  <p>The teeth are mostly spatulate, laterally compressed, with sharp edges, but without serrations.
  Skull with a pair of large pre-orbital fossae. The centra of the vertebrae of the trunk have large
  lateral cavities. The fore- and hind-limbs are pentadactyle, plantigrade, and hoofed, of the
  typical walking type; the bones of the limbs are stout and solid; the femur is devoid of an inner
  distal or fourth trochanter. The carpal and tarsal bones are free. Herbivorous. The Sauropoda
  comprise some of the most gigantic terrestrial creatures which have ever existed, compared with
  some of which the bulk of an elephant appears almost insignificant. Their range in time extends
  from the Lower Oolite into the Cretaceous, with a perhaps world-wide distribution, namely, Western
  Europe, North America, Patagonia, Madagascar, and India. Although they are, except for their size,
  the least specialised of all Dinosaurs, none of the Sauropoda hitherto discovered are old enough
  to claim to be the ancestors of the other Dinosaurs.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Brontosaurus excelsus</i> of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming was a giant at least 60 feet long
  and about 10 feet high. The head is extremely small in proportion, not so broad as the fourth of
  the thirteen vertebrae of the long and flexible neck. The trunk is comparatively short, the tail
  longer than the neck, and provided with numerous chevron-bones. Most of the vertebrae are hollow,
  especially the five co-ossified sacrals. The spinal canal of the sacral region is very wide,
  indicating a strong sacral swelling in conformity with the huge posterior limbs. The pubic bones
  are stronger than the ischia. The long axis of the <span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span
  class="smaller">{419}</span></span>former stands almost vertically like that of elephants, and the
  knee is scarcely bent in the erect position. The shoulder-girdle consists of long scapulae, broad
  at the base and small, almost square and perforated coracoids, which latter fit into a pair of
  partly ossified plates representing the sternum.</p>

  <p><i>Atlantosaurus immanis</i> of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming and Colorado, is supposed to have
  been 115 feet long, perhaps the biggest and bulkiest of all animals, the femur measuring more than
  6 feet in length and 2 in width at the upper end.</p>

  <p><i>Morosaurus grandis</i>, of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming, with allied forms in the Purbeck
  and Wealden of England, reached a length of 30 feet; in general appearance resembling
  <i>Brontosaurus</i>, but the sacrum consists of four vertebrae only, and the ischia are bent
  backwards in their distal halves, so that their symphysis is formed by the shafts instead of by
  their ends.</p>

  <p><i>Ornithopsis</i> and <i>Cetiosaurus</i>, likewise huge creatures, from the English Wealden
  and from the Great Oolite respectively, are rather imperfectly known, although several species of
  each, under many generic synonyms, have been described.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Diplodocus longus</i>, of the Upper Jurassic of Colorado and Wyoming, is almost completely
  known. More than 40 feet long, it had a head in its general outlines not unlike that of a horse,
  the skull being about two feet long. The outer nasal openings are confluent, elongated, and lie
  far back on the top of the skull. There is a pair of large antorbital, and a pair of smaller
  lacrymal fossae. The teeth, long and slender, are restricted to the anterior portion of the mouth,
  with many successors, which, decreasing in size, lie on the inner or lingual side of the
  functional tooth, like the cartridges in a repeating rifle. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page420"><span class="smaller">{420}</span></span>functional teeth themselves are implanted in
  sockets. The generic name refers to the peculiar chevron-bones, each half of which diverges into
  an anterior and a posterior branch.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is difficult to understand how these huge, long-necked Sauropoda lived and moved
  about. The long neck suggests at first sight predacious habits, but the teeth, rather feeble in
  <i>Diplodocus</i>, and distinctly of the plant-cutting type in other genera, put this out of the
  question. The high position of the unpaired nasal opening, and the shortened nasal bones of
  <i>Diplodocus</i>, are features indicative of aquatic habits, but the short-toed, plantigrade
  limbs are absolutely adapted to terrestrial life, and we cannot well assume that such enormous
  brutes as <i>Atlantosaurus</i> could possibly have ventured into swampy ground.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. THEROPODA.</b></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pubes simple, with symphysis. Premaxillae with teeth. Digitigrade.
  Carnivorous.</i></p>

  <p>The teeth are pointed, recurved, laterally compressed and serrated. The nasal openings are
  large, lateral, and nearly terminal. The vertebrae and the large bones of the limbs are hollow.
  The fore-limbs are considerably shorter than the hind-limbs, which are distinctly digitigrade,
  many of the species having a pronouncedly upright gait. The proximal tarsalia show a tendency to
  fuse with the tibia, and the astragalus has sometimes an ascending process, by which the fusion
  with the tibia is strengthened. The first and fifth metatarsals are often reduced, while the three
  middle bones are elongated and sometimes even fused with each other, so that the whole foot
  assumes a striking resemblance to that of birds. The terminal phalanges are protected by curved
  claws. Owing to the shortness of the fore-limbs, and the often considerable length of the
  hind-limbs, which are strongly bent at the knee and the ankle-joint, these animals must have
  progressed somewhat like clumsy kangaroos.</p>

  <p>The Theropoda, of which a great number of genera are now known, from the size of a slender cat
  to that of an elephant, lived from the Upper Trias to the Upper Oolite, both in Europe and in
  North America.</p>

  <p><i>Brontozoum giganteum</i>, one of the oldest forms, is known <span class="pagenum"
  id="page421"><span class="smaller">{421}</span></span>from its foot-spoors only, which, together
  with other three-toed spoors in the sandstone of the Connecticut valley, were originally described
  and figured by Hitchcock as <i>Ornithichnites</i> (<span title="ichnos"
  class="fsn">&#x1F34;&chi;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> = track, or spoor). Some of these imprints
  are more than a foot in length, the right and left spoors following alternately at a distance of
  from four to six feet. In some cases the long trailing tail has left a furrow behind, and the
  large tracks are accompanied or crossed by much smaller, and even by quite tiny tracks, otherwise
  similar, and undoubtedly made by the young.</p>

  <p><i>Anchisaurus</i>, from the same locality, was still Sauropodous, in so far as the metatarsals
  are still free, with two, three, four, and five phalanges on the first four toes, but the fifth
  metatarsal is reduced, carrying a vestige of only one phalanx, and the proximal tarsal bones are
  fused with the tibia and fibula respectively. Total length some seven feet, of which about four
  belong to the tail.</p>

  <p><i>Zanclodon</i>, from the Keuper of W&uuml;rtemberg, about ten feet long, with pentadactyle hands
  and feet. Ischia stronger than the pubic bones, which are distally much broadened. The femur is
  nearly three feet long, and possesses a fourth trochanter. The astragalus has an ascending
  process, and is fused with the tibia. The toes are short, strong, and clawed. The shoulder-girdle
  and fore-limb are strong, the latter well adapted to grasping. The teeth are much compressed
  laterally, with sharp, finely serrated edges. Several allied genera have been described from the
  Upper Trias of France and England: others from corresponding strata of India and South Africa.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Ceratosaurus nasicornis</i>, from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado, is about seventeen feet
  long. The generic and specific names refer to the nasal bones, which are raised into an unpaired
  longitudinal crest. This, by its rough surface, suggests that it was covered by a horny sheath, or
  carried a horn. The large skull, about two feet in length, is armed with strong, slightly curved,
  laterally compressed, sharp teeth, unequal in size. The pre-orbital foramen is large, bordered
  above by the prefrontals, which are raised into prominent knobs. The supratemporal foramina are
  extremely small, the lateral foramina very large. The quadrate slants backwards. The sacrum
  consists of five vertebrae. The caudal vertebrae carry long and slender chevron-bones. The pubes
  and ischia are long and slender, each forming a separate symphysis at their broadened ends. The
  three <span class="pagenum" id="page423"><span class="smaller">{423}</span></span>metatarsals are
  elongated and fused with each other. There seems to have been some dermal armour in the shape of
  osseous plates, which extended in one series from the occiput over the neck.</p>

  <p><i>Coelurus gracilis</i>, of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming, and closely allied forms in the
  Wealden of England, are remarkable for the pneumaticity of the centra and processes of their
  vertebrae, the bony parts of which are restricted to thin, hollowed-out shells, so that the whole
  skeleton must have been very light. Computed length of these imperfectly preserved creatures about
  five feet.</p>

  <p><i>Hallopus victor</i>, of the Upper Jurassic of Colorado. Anterior extremities very short,
  with only four fingers; posterior limbs very long and slender, especially the tibia; the much
  elongated metatarsals are separate, the first absent, the fifth much reduced, so that the foot is
  tridactyle; the calcaneum projects like a heel. The ilium is attached to two sacral vertebrae
  only; the pubes are slender, forming a narrow symphysis, while that of the ischia is broad. Most
  of the bones of this creature, which probably progressed by hops, are hollow. Total length about
  three feet, the length of the hind-limbs being about nine inches.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Compsognathus longipes</i>, of the Upper Jurassic of Bavaria, is one of the
  smallest of all the Dinosaurs. It is most remarkable on account of its almost bird-like feet. The
  fibula is much thinner and somewhat shorter than the tibia; the latter is closely attached to,
  although not fused with the proximal tarsal bones, while the distal tarsals are fused with the
  united and much elongated second, third, and fourth metatarsals; the fifth is reduced to a short
  bone near the intertarsal joint; while the first is represented by its distal portion only, which
  is stowed away on the hinder aspect of the middle of the second metatarsal, and carries two
  phalanges. The three middle toes consist of three, four, and four phalanges respectively. Whilst
  the whole hind-limb is typically avian, the pelvis is quite different; the pubic bones are simple,
  slender, and directed forwards, forming a symphysis with their whole distal halves, and broadening
  out distally into a horizontal process directed towards the symphysis, which is likewise formed by
  the fusion of the inner surfaces of the thin and rather flat ischia. The fore-limbs are only half
  the size of the hind-limbs. The neck consists of about ten vertebrae, mostly with long and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page424"><span class="smaller">{424}</span></span>pointed ribs. Tail long with
  well-developed chevrons. The skull is long and pointed, composed of thin bones, which have lost
  most of the sutures; with large lateral, temporal, and pre-orbital, but without supratemporal,
  foramina. Premaxillae, maxillae, and mandible with numerous slender and rather long, conical,
  alveolar teeth.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. ORTHOPODA</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Each pubic bone consists of an anterior or pre-pubic and a posterior or
    post-pubic branch, neither of which forms a symphysis. Premaxillae without teeth. With a
    premandibular predentary piece. Herbivorous.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The so-called pre-pubis is homologous with the pubis of most recent reptiles, and with the
  pectineal process of birds, while the "post-pubis" is homologous with the processus lateralis of
  Chelonians and Saurians, and with the "pubis" of birds. The right and left halves of the pubis
  remain widely asunder ventrally. In many cases the post-pubis, always directed obliquely
  backwards, lies closely against the shaft of the ischium, which always forms a distal syndesmosis,
  or a symphysis, with its fellow. The fore-limbs are usually very short, provided with five or four
  short and strong fingers. The hind-limbs are long and strong, mostly with three, sometimes with
  four functional short toes, either plantigrade (<span class="sc">Stegosauri</span>) or digitigrade
  (<span class="sc">Ornithopoda</span>). Femur with an inner distal, or fourth, trochanter. The
  dentition is of the herbivorous type, restricted to the dentaries of the mandible and to the
  maxillary bones, leaving the whole or the greater part of the premaxillaries free. The additional
  "predentary" piece of the mandible is possibly a calcified, but originally horny, pad. The teeth
  are greatly compressed laterally, and finely serrated, but are much ground down by use; several
  rows of successional teeth lie on the inner or lingual side. The skull is strongly built, with
  large anterior nasal openings; pre-orbital foramina very small or absent; orbits completely
  encircled by bones; supratemporal foramina small, lateral foramina large. Quadrate large, vertical
  or slanting slightly forwards. The vertebrae are solid, not hollow; sacrum consisting of four,
  five, or more vertebrae; ribs bifurcated, the capitula carried either by the centra, or moved up
  to the diapophyses of the neural arches; chevron-bones <span class="pagenum" id="page425"><span
  class="smaller">{425}</span></span>numerous, and frequently long, especially on the anterior half
  of the long and heavy tail.</p>

  <p>Orthopoda occur from the Lias to the Upper Cretaceous, both in Europe and in North America. The
  name Orthopoda, invented by Cope in 1866, is appropriate for obvious reasons; it comprises the
  Stegosauri and Ornithopoda of Marsh (1881). The latter term is not very fortunately chosen,
  considering that the whole hind-limb of the Theropodous <i>Compsognathus</i> is far more ornithic
  than that of any three-toed Ornithopoda, in which the tarsalia rarely fuse with the tibia and
  never with the metatarsals. To apply the term Ornithopoda to the whole order is quite
  unjustifiable, unless it is meant to apply to the strikingly bird-like configuration of the
  pelvis.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Stegosauri.</b>&ndash;The fore- and hind-feet are plantigrade, or nearly so,
  the metapodials being but little elongated, with more than three functional digits. The bones of
  the limbs are solid. The ribs of the trunk are bifurcated, and are carried by the diapophyses of
  the neural arches. The body, especially the back, is protected by dermal bony plates, which are
  not connected with the internal skeleton.</p>

  <p><i>Scelidosaurus harrisoni.</i> One nearly complete skeleton, about 11 feet in length, from the
  Lias of Lyme Regis. About twenty-four pre-sacral vertebrae, of which six or seven belong to the
  neck, four sacral and about forty caudal vertebrae. Four fingers, four toes, with 2, 3, 4, 5
  phalanges, the fifth metapodials being quite vestigial; the hallux and pollex are very short, so
  that the foot at least is functionally tridactyle. The tarsal bones remain separate. The head is
  very small. Two rows of ridged bony plates extend from the neck over the back, and converge into
  one row upon the long tail; smaller plates, arranged in many rows, seem to have protected the
  sides and under parts. <i>Hylaeosaurus</i> and <i>Polacanthus</i> of the English Wealden are
  allied forms.</p>

  <p><i>Stegosaurus</i>, with several species from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado and Wyoming, and
  others, e.g. <i>S. armatus</i> (= <i>Omosaurus</i>), from the Kimmeridge Clay of Wiltshire in
  England. The head is relatively very small, and the brain is surpassed several times in thickness
  by the huge sacral swelling of the spinal cord. Teeth numerous and small. All the cervical and
  trunk-vertebrae carry bifurcated ribs, those of the trunk being carried entirely by the very high
  neural arches. The fore-limbs are only about half <span class="pagenum" id="page426"><span
  class="smaller">{426}</span></span>the length of that of the hind-limbs, so that these creatures,
  which were undoubtedly quadrupedal, must have had a very peculiar gait, standing with the head,
  neck, and shoulders much lower than the arched back and pelvic region. The ulna has a strong
  olecranon; the hand has four functional fingers. The pre-acetabular portion of the ilium is much
  elongated; the pre-pubic branch stands horizontally, while the post-pubis is closely adpressed to
  the ischium. The astragalus is fused with the tibia, the calcaneum with the fibula. The foot has
  only three short toes, protected, like the fingers, by hoofs. The dorsal dermal armature consists
  of very high, crest-like plates. <i>S. ungulatus</i> of North America has a computed length of 28
  feet, with the hind-limbs about 7 feet long. This creature was nearly 10 feet high, when measured
  from the ground to the tips of the dermal crests on the middle of the back. These bony, laterally
  compressed plates are themselves nearly 3 feet high, and are replaced, on the hinder portion of
  the tail, by several pairs of pointed spikes about 2 feet in length.</p>

  <p><i>Camptosaurus.</i>&ndash;Several species, up to 10 feet in length, from <span class="pagenum"
  id="page427"><span class="smaller">{427}</span></span>the Upper Jurassic and the Wealden of North
  America and England. Five fingers, with 2, 3, 3, 3, 2 phalanges and four toes, with 2, 3, 4, 5
  phalanges, but the hallux is much shortened and does not touch the hard ground; astragalus and
  calcaneum separate.</p>

  <p><i>Laosaurus</i> of Colorado is a smaller form, intermediate in structure between the former
  genus and <i>Hypsilophodon foxi</i> from the Wealden of the Isle of Wight. A small creature, less
  than 5 feet in length. Four fingers, with 2, 3, 4, 2 phalanges; fifth metacarpal vestigial. Four
  toes with 2, 3, 4, 5 phalanges and long claws. Astragalus and calcaneum separate. Post-pubis very
  slender. Each premaxillary with five pointed alveolar teeth, leaving a wide median diastema;
  maxillaries with eleven, dentaries with ten laterally compressed blade-like teeth.</p>

  <p><i>Iguanodon</i> from the Wealden of England, Belgium, and Germany. Apparently two species,
  <i>I. mantelli</i>, about 16 feet, <i>I. bernissartensis</i> nearly 30 feet long. The premaxilla
  is quite toothless; the teeth of the maxillae and mandibles stand in close series, implanted in
  alveolae; they are spatulate, laterally compressed, with finely serrated edges, and slightly
  curved, the lower outwards, the upper inwards, and bear a general resemblance to those of
  <i>Iguana</i>, hence the generic name. There is only one functional set of teeth, and these are
  much worn down by use, but in such a way that, owing to the different curvature of the opposed
  teeth, the worn-down crowns form cutting, and at the same time crushing, almost triturating
  surfaces, indicating that these animals lived upon herbs. The gait of these creatures was upright,
  as shown by their spoors; the long almost vertical ischia, which form a padded symphysis, only
  slightly raised above the ground, suggest that this symphysis was used as a true sitting support,
  the animal resting upon it, the hind-limbs and the long tail. The latter, to judge from the long
  chevrons and the high neural spinous processes, must have been furnished with strong muscles. The
  whole tail was undoubtedly used as a balance during the upright position. Many of the tendons of
  the dorsal spinal muscles on the back and upper half of the tail are ossified. The post-pubic
  branches are very slender, distally much reduced, and, except at the obturator-foramen, separated
  from the ischia; the pre-pubes are very strong and broad. The femur has a fourth trochanter, a
  feature which <span class="pagenum" id="page428"><span class="smaller">{428}</span></span>induced
  the unfortunate late Paul Albrecht to declare that <i>Iguanodon</i> was a reptilian Duck! The
  tarsal bones are separate. The metatarsals and toes are reduced to three, with 3, 4, 5 phalanges
  respectively, the first being a mere styliform vestige. The anterior limbs are likewise very
  powerful, but are much shorter; the hands are adapted for grasping, possibly for defence and
  offence, as indicated by the pollex, which, although short, is transformed into a formidable
  spur-like weapon, firmly fixed at a right angle to the other four fingers, the phalanges of which
  number 3, 3, 3, 4; the second and third fingers were protected by hoof-like nails, the fifth
  finger is feeble, and stands somewhat apart. The whole vertebral column consists of more than
  eighty vertebrae, of which ten are cervical, eighteen thoracic and lumbar, while five or six are
  fused into the sacrum. The cervical vertebrae are opisthocoelous, and carry short ribs, except the
  atlas, which possesses two separate supra-dorsal pieces, which fill the gap between it and the
  occiput.</p>

  <p>Many specimens of <i>I. bernissartensis</i>, which is now completely known, including even the
  hyoid bones, were discovered in 1878, in the Belgian colliery of Bernissart, between Mons and
  Tournai, close to the French frontier. The bones were in a fault or crack, filled with clay of
  Wealden age, about one thousand feet below the present sea-level, and there about thirty
  Iguanodons, all <span class="pagenum" id="page429"><span
  class="smaller">{429}</span></span>apparently adult, had become embedded. Five of them are now
  mounted in one of the public galleries of the Brussels Museum, of which these perfect monsters
  form one of the chief attractions. Having proved to be such a valuable find, they were claimed by
  the Government, on the ground that Iguanodons were not included in the license of the Coal Mining
  Company. The fact that not only <i>I. bernissartensis</i>, but also a few specimens of <i>I.
  mantelli</i>, already known from England, where the large form likewise occurs, were found in the
  same place, makes the specific differences somewhat doubtful; they are perhaps sexual.</p>

  <p><i>Claosaurus</i> of the uppermost Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, is one of the latest of
  Dinosaurs. It is nearly allied to <i>Iguanodon</i>, but has only three functional fingers, the
  fifth being absent, whilst the pollex is very short.</p>

  <p><i>Hadrosaurus</i> s. <i>Diclonius</i> of the same level as the preceding genus in North
  America, apparently also in the Middle and Upper Chalk of England and Belgium, has a most peculiar
  spoon-shaped bill, the premaxilla and the predental bone being spatulate and quite toothless. The
  teeth in the upper and lower jaws are numerous and small, and whilst one set of teeth is being
  ground down, the several successional series are already functional. <i>H. mirabilis</i> has in
  all about 2000 teeth; the total length of the skeleton is 38 feet, of which nearly 4 feet are
  taken up by the skull; in other respects this genus is allied to <i>Iguanodon</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Ornithomimus</i>, of the Upper Cretaceous of Colorado, is known only from its
  fore- and hind-limbs. The fore-limbs are short, with three fingers. The hind-limbs are very long
  and strikingly bird-like. The metatarsals, of which only the second, third, and fourth are
  developed, are much elongated; the proximal half of the third is pushed back between the second
  and fourth, and imperfectly fused with them, exactly as in young birds. The astragalus has a long
  ascending process, and is fused with the tibia. The fibula is very slender, distally much reduced;
  the calcaneum is represented by a tiny nodule; the terminal phalanges end in pointed claws. <i>O.
  grandis</i> must have reached a considerable size, to judge from its middle metatarsal, which is
  60 cm. or 2 feet long. Until more is known of these extraordinary creatures, nothing definite can
  be said about their affinities. They may perhaps belong to the Theropoda.</p>

  <p>The teeth of the upper and lower jaws are alveolar, and have two roots. The fore-limbs are
  little shorter than the hind-limbs; pentadactyle and plantigrade, with broad hoofs. Femur without

  <p>To define Crocodilia in general and to distinguish them from various extinct groups we have to
  resort to additional characters. The vertebrae are solid; the ribs of the neck and thorax possess
  a distinct capitulum and tuberculum; there is a series of loose, compound abdominal ribs; the
  humerus is devoid of an entepicondylar foramen; the iliac bones are broadened out and attached to
  two sacral vertebrae; the pubic bones are simple, not bifurcated, and neither they nor the ischia
  are ventrally united. The skull always has a strong, bony, quadrato-jugal arch. The possession of
  a longitudinal cloacal opening and of <span class="pagenum" id="page432"><span
  class="smaller">{432}</span></span>an anterior or ventral single copulatory organ can of course be
  asserted of recent forms only.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In spite of these many characters common to all Crocodilia, it is very difficult to
  separate the latter from the Dinosauria, the only absolute difference lying in the ventral pelvic
  bones. It is therefore most suggestive that the fore-limbs of the Mesozoic Crocodilia are so much
  shorter and weaker than their hind-limbs, a discrepancy which is not lessened before the Tertiary
  epoch. The Mesozoic Crocodilia were almost entirely marine; the strongly-developed ankle-joint
  (indicated already by such early forms as <i>Aetosaurus</i> and <i>Mystriosaurus</i>) must have
  been inherited from some terrestrial group with digitigrade tendencies and shortened hind-limbs.
  All this points to some Theropodous Dinosaurian stock of which the Crocodilia may well form an
  aquatic, further-developed branch. Loss of the pubic and ischiadic ventral symphysis is not a
  serious modification. So far as modern reptiles are concerned only the Chelonia and
  <i>Sphenodon</i> are related to the Crocodilia, whilst Monitors and other lizards resemble them
  only superficially. We divide them into three Orders.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. PSEUDOSUCHIA.</b></p>

  <p>The few members of this peculiar group of reptiles are all restricted to the Keuper or
  variegated marls, although they seem to have had a wide distribution, some having been found in
  Germany, others in New Mexico. They perhaps form an early side-branch of the generalised
  Crocodilian stock, which died out with the Jurassic age.</p>

  <p>The skull is distinctly short and pointed. The premaxillaries are very small and are dorsally
  separated from each other by the large nasals, which also keep the maxillae widely asunder. The
  nostrils are latero-terminal, bordered chiefly by the nasals, below by the premaxillae and part of
  the maxillae. The orbit is bordered below by the strong jugals, in front by the prefrontal, above
  by a supra-orbital and a small postfrontal, behind by a postorbital, which, firmly connected with
  the jugal and squamosal, shuts off a supratemporal foramen. There is also a lateral temporal
  fossa, and a large hole enclosed by the lacrymal and the maxillary bones. The teeth are restricted
  to the anterior <span class="pagenum" id="page433"><span class="smaller">{433}</span></span>half
  of the jaws. The neck, back, and tail are covered by two rows of large and broad, closely-jointed
  bony plates; smaller plates protect the sides and the ventral surface. The vertebrae are still
  unknown.</p>

  <p><i>A&euml;tosaurus ferratus</i> of the Upper Keuper near Stuttgart is the best known. One of the
  greatest treasures of the Stuttgart Museum is a slab of sandstone, about 2 square yards in size,
  upon which lie huddled together twenty-four individuals of various sizes, the largest measuring 86
  cm. or 2 feet 10 inches. They are in a beautiful state of preservation, and many of them are in
  the most life-like attitudes, just as if a mass of sand had fallen upon them and crushed them
  down, and as if they were struggling to get out.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Erpetosuchus</i> and <i>Ornithosuchus</i> of the Elgin sandstone seem to be
  allied forms.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. PARASUCHIA.</b></p>

  <p>As the name implies, a collateral branch of the true Crocodilia. They are, like the
  Pseudosuchia, restricted to the Keuper formation. The vertebrae are mostly biconcave, sometimes
  with nearly plain, scarcely concave, central joints. The premaxillae are very long and powerful.
  The nostrils lie far back, rather near the orbits, on the top of the snout, within the anterior
  half of each nasal and almost above the choanae. The latter are situated in front of the palatine
  bones and are divided by a backwardly directed process of the vomer, which is plainly visible on
  the roof of the mouth. The palatines and pterygoids leave a wide median space between them. The
  pterygoids are narrow and have three processes, the antero-lateral of which joins the palatines
  and the maxillary bones (there being no separate ectopterygoid), the inner joins the
  basi-occipital, and the postero-lateral the quadrate.</p>

  <p>The orbit is surrounded by the frontal, prefrontal, lacrymal, postorbital and postfrontal,
  while the strong jugal is excluded. The temporal region shows a lateral and a dorsal foramen; the
  latter opens backwards and above the occiput, being bordered in front by the parietal, laterally
  by the squamoso-occipital bridge.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are amphicoelous.  The first and second <span class="pagenum" id="page434"><span
  class="smaller">{434}</span></span>vertebrae are devoid of ribs; the cervicals and first thoracics
  carry separate capitular and tubercular processes for the attachment of the ribs, while the ribs
  of the rest of the trunk are carried entirely by the long diapophyses, as in the modern
  Crocodiles. The dermal armour consists of two rows of broad, dorsal, and several rows of smaller,
  lateral, bony plates.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Belodon</i> is by far the best-known genus, with several species in South
  Germany and North America, some of which reached a length of 10 feet, without ventral armour. The
  closely allied <i>Stagonolepis</i> of the Elgin sandstone in Scotland had dorsal and ventral
  armour. Other genera in the Triassic formations of India and North America.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. EUSUCHIA.</b></p>

  <p>Crocodilia in the stricter sense. The premaxillae are short and always enclose the nostrils.
  The choanae lie behind the palatines, in recent forms even within the pterygoids. They occur from
  the Liassic or Lower Jurassic period to the present time.</p>

  <p>The direct ancestors of the Eusuchia are still unknown. They cannot have been developed from
  the Pseudosuchia, nor do we know intermediate stages which connect them with the Parasuchia. The
  nostrils, situated within the premaxillaries, always lie in front of the nasals, although these
  sometimes extend forwards and form a bony internasal septum fusing with the usual cartilaginous
  septum. The choanae, instead of opening immediately behind the vomer, are carried far back, owing
  to the formation of a secondary bony palate. In the Jurassic Crocodiles this roof is formed by the
  meeting of the palatine bones in the medio-ventral line, and the choanae open immediately behind.
  From Cretaceous times onwards this roofing is continued by the pterygoids, which likewise form a
  median suture; and the united choanae (which may, or may not, be divided by a thin bony septum)
  are pushed towards the posterior end of the pterygoids. Since the Jurassic times there exists also
  a tendency to enclose the Eustachian passages (the remnants of the first gill-clefts) by bone. In
  the earlier members they were still wide slits or open grooves on the ventral side of the
  basi-occipital bone. Since the Cretaceous epoch they have been transformed into bony canals and
  open through one median hole, situated between the basi-occipital and the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page435"><span class="smaller">{435}</span></span>basisphenoid, immediately behind the
  posterior symphysis of the dorsal portion of the pterygoids, which latter almost completely cover
  the basisphenoid. The vomer is not visible (except in <i>Caiman niger</i>), being covered by the
  ventral junction of the palatines and maxillaries. The broad, lateral wings of the pterygoids are
  connected by separate bones, the ectopterygoids = transpalatines = transverse bones, with the
  maxillaries, and in recent forms also with the jugals. Thus an extensive, very firm bony palate is
  produced; and the large palatal foramina, between the palatines, maxillaries, ectopterygoids and
  pterygoids, are closed by the same dense mucous membrane which cover the whole roof of the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>The opisthotic and epi-otic bones fuse early with the lateral and with the supra-occipital
  bones; only the pro-otic remains longer as a separate element, perforated anteriorly by a large
  hole for the exit of the third branch of the trigeminal nerve. The basisphenoid is scarcely
  visible, being covered by the pterygoids. The presphenoid is large, continued forwards and upwards
  into the usually cartilaginous interorbital septum. Near the anterior and upper margin of the
  presphenoid is a large notch on either side for the passage of the optic nerve, the three
  eye-muscle nerves and the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. There are no separate
  orbito-sphenoids, their place being taken by membrane or cartilage in continuation with the
  interorbital septum, but the alisphenoids are large, abutting upwards against the frontals. Each
  prefrontal sends down a vertical process which joins the palatine of its side.</p>

  <p>The configuration of the snout varies much. There are two parallel lines of development since
  the Jurassic epoch, namely, long-snouted creatures, of which two still survive as <i>Gavialis</i>
  and <i>Tomistoma</i>, and more broad and short-snouted members like the rest of the Crocodiles and
  Alligators. In opposition to the Parasuchia the elongation of the snout is effected by the
  maxillaries. The length of the nasals varies much, mostly in conformity with that of the
  maxillaries. As a rule they reach the premaxillaries but not always the nasal groove. In
  <i>Gavialis</i> they are short, far separated from the premaxillaries by the maxillaries, which
  meet in the dorso-median line. The orbit is bordered by the frontals, which at an early age fuse
  into an unpaired piece, and by the prefrontal, lacrymal, jugal, and postfrontal. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page436"><span class="smaller">{436}</span></span>At a deeper level the orbit
  is partly divided from the lateral temporal fossa by a strong column which is formed by the
  meeting of a downward process of the postfrontal with an inner process of the jugal, and an
  ascending process of the ectopterygoid (cf. Fig. 108, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page458">458</a></span>). This arrangement adds considerably to the strength of the skull.
  The lateral temporal fossa is bordered in front by the column just described; below by the jugal
  and the quadrato-jugal, which is firmly wedged in between the jugal and quadrate; behind by the
  quadrate; above by the postfrontal, which forms a strong superficial bridge with the squamosal.
  This rests upon and often fuses with the quadrate and an intervening transverse wing-like
  extension of the lateral occipital bone. By this squamoso-postfrontal bridge part of the original
  temporal fossa is divided into the lateral one just described, and a dorsal fossa. The latter is
  bordered by the postfrontal, squamosal, and united parietals. This dorsal temporal fossa is
  consequently not homologous with that of the Parasuchia, a vestige of which is however present in
  many, especially in young skulls of Crocodiles, in the shape of a narrow passage which extends
  backwards from the dorsal fossa, bridged over by the junction of the parietal with the squamosal,
  and bordered below by the occipitals.</p>

  <p>The size of the upper temporal fossae stands in an inverse ratio to that of the lateral fossae.
  In the older Eusuchia the upper were the larger of the two. The temporo-mandibular muscle which
  lifts or shuts the lower jaw arises from the walls of the upper fossa, passes beneath the jugal
  arch, and is inserted into the supra-angular portion of the lower jaw. In the more recent
  Crocodiles this muscle is more and more superseded by the pterygo-mandibular muscle, which,
  arising chiefly from the dorsal surface of the much broadened-out pterygoid bone, fills the
  widened space between the latter and the quadrate, and is inserted into the outer surface of the
  os angulare of the lower jaw. This muscle, owing to its general disposition, is capable of much
  more powerful development and leverage than the temporo-maxillary muscle, which latter, being more
  reduced, allows the dorsal fossae to be more and more closed up by the surrounding bones.</p>

  <p>The fossae are still comparatively large in the long-snouted genera <i>Gavialis</i> and
  <i>Tomistoma</i>, which live entirely upon fish and scarcely chew their food, whilst these holes
  almost completely <span class="pagenum" id="page437"><span
  class="smaller">{437}</span></span>disappear in some of the Alligators, namely in the broad- and
  short-snouted members, which, having a varied diet, taken from every available group of the animal
  kingdom, chew their prey.</p>

  <p>The quadrate extends obliquely backwards, and is immovably wedged in and partly fused with the
  quadrato-jugal, the squamosal, and the lateral occipital wings. Between the latter and the
  quadrate remains a slit-like canal, well visible from behind, through which passes the
  continuation into the mandible of the columellar or ossicular chain of the auditory apparatus.
  Intricate passages, used as additional enlargements of the space of the middle ear, pervade the
  proximal portions of the quadrate and the roof of the cranium beneath the parietal bridges
  mentioned above, the two sides communicating with each other. The supra-occipital bone is visible
  from behind; its top is covered and partly fused with a continuation of the parietals, which are,
  like the frontals, fused into an unpaired mass. The occipital condyle is formed entirely by the
  basi-occipital bone, so far as the articulating facet is concerned, but it is supported on either
  side by a lamella from the lateral occipitals.</p>

  <p>The two halves of the lower jaw form a symphysis of very variable length. Each half is composed
  of six bones. (1) The articulare, perforated in its upper, posterior, inner corner by a canal for
  the reception of the siphonium, a narrow tube of connective tissue, which connects the cavities of
  the middle ear with the large empty space enclosed within the lower jaw; (2) the angulare; (3) the
  dentary, which alone carries the teeth; (4) the splenial, a long splint-like bone on the surface
  of the inner or median side of the jaw, of variable length; (5) the operculare, the counterpart of
  the splenial on the outer side; (6) the supra-angulare, which forms the dorsal border of the lower
  jaw between the dentary and the angulare.</p>

  <p>The teeth, which are more or less conical or compressed laterally, are deeply implanted in
  separate sockets. They are often shed throughout life, the successors lying on the median side,
  and with their caps partly fitting into the wide, open roots of the teeth to be expelled. The
  number of teeth in the premaxilla is universally five on either side in recent forms, but in a few
  species, e.g. <i>Crocodilus niloticus</i> and <i>C. porosus</i>, the second pair is lost with
  maturity and is not replaced. In the broad-snouted <span class="pagenum" id="page438"><span
  class="smaller">{438}</span></span>kinds, especially in the Alligators, most of the upper teeth
  overlap laterally those of the lower jaw. In most species of <i>Crocodilus</i> the overlapping is
  less marked and the teeth partly interlock, but the fourth mandibular tooth, generally the
  strongest and longest, is received into a lateral notch at the junction of the premaxillary and
  maxillary. Frequently those of the longer lower teeth which fit into pits of the upper jaw,
  gradually transform the pits into holes by continued pressure upon the bone, and in old specimens
  the tip of the lower tooth may even perforate and stand out above the skin of the snout.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are solid, but remnants of the notochord persist for a long time in the middle of
  the centra. These are still amphicoelous in the Jurassic Eusuchia, and there were probably
  considerable intervertebral portions of the notochord. From the Lower Chalk onwards the vertebrae
  are procoelous, with the exception of the first caudal vertebra, which has a knob at either end,
  so that naturally the posterior of the two sacral vertebrae is opisthocoelous. This peculiar
  formation of the first caudal is probably correlated with the flexibility of the tail.</p>

  <p>Cartilaginous intercentral rings, pads or menisci, occur regularly throughout the vertebral
  column, unless they are abolished by fusion of adjoining vertebrae. It is most instructive to
  follow the attachment of the ribs in one and the same individual. The position of the capitulum,
  vertically below the tuberculum in the neck, changes in the thorax into one in which the capitulum
  lies anterior to the tuberculum and in the same horizontal plane with it. Moreover, whilst on the
  cervical vertebrae the capitulum is carried by the centrum (enclosing with the tuberculum a
  typical transverse canal for the vertebral artery, etc.), further back it moves its point of
  attachment upwards, lying right upon the neuro-central suture on the tenth and eleventh vertebrae.
  From the twelfth vertebra backwards both capitulum and tuberculum are carried by the transverse
  process or diapophysis of the neural arch. The ribs of the five or six lumbar vertebrae are merely
  vestigial or absent. The ribs of the two sacral vertebrae are very stout, fusing in the adult with
  both centrum and neural arch. Some of the anterior caudal vertebrae also carry ribs, attached
  across the neuro-central suture; long before maturity they fuse with their vertebrae, and then
  look like transverse processes. Most of the caudal vertebrae carry also a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page439"><span class="smaller">{439}</span></span>pair of chevron-bones, and these are
  continuous with the intercentral rings of cartilage.</p>

  <p>The atlas and the epistropheus or axis are of supreme interest. Crocodiles are, in fact, the
  only animals in which these two vertebrae retain all their constituent hard parts in an almost
  undisturbed primitive condition (Fig. 103, <span class="smaller">1-4</span>). The basal piece of
  the atlas-ring, the first basiventral or intercentrum, carries a pair of long ribs attached by
  their capitular portions. A small knob near the dorsal edge of the rib occurs in many specimens,
  and is the last remnant of the tubercular portion. The latter was still complete in Jurassic
  Crocodiles, for instance in <i>Metriorhynchus</i> (Fig. 103, <span class="smaller">2</span>,
  <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>). The first centrum joins that of the second vertebra as its so-called
  odontoid process, not directly, however, but by the intercalation of the complete second
  basiventral, represented by a cartilaginous disc, and by a large unpaired pyramidal piece (Fig.
  103, <span class="smaller">3</span>, <sup>2</sup>). This, serially homologous with the ventral
  half of the atlas-ring, is the second basiventral intercentrum, wedged in from below between the
  odontoid process and the second centrum, with which it soon fuses. Moreover, it carries the
  capitulum of the second rib (2, <i>Cp<sup>2</sup></i>), the tuberculum of which is articulated
  with a facet of the second neural arch in Jurassic Eusuchia (<i>t<sub>2</sub></i>). In recent
  Crocodiles this tubercular portion is much reduced, and, curiously enough, is attached to a knob
  which belongs to the odontoid piece or first centrum. This shifting explains the apparently
  anomalous condition that "the atlas of the Crocodiles carries two pairs of ribs, the second
  vertebra none." To complete the account of the atlas we have to mention the separate unpaired
  piece which lies upon the two neural arches. It is the detached neural spine, and not the remnant
  of a "pro-atlas."</p>

  <p>The first and second ribs (<i>R<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>), at least in the
  recent forms, are very long and are quite movable. Those of the next five cervical vertebrae are
  firmly fixed, short, and adze-shaped. The eighth and ninth are again long, and make the transition
  to the thoracic ribs, which are mostly eight in number, some with uncinate processes. Then follow
  several shorter or floating ribs, mostly two or three pairs. The next following three presacral
  vertebrae carry no ribs. The two sacral and the caudal ribs have already been mentioned.</p>

  <p>As a rule the vertebral column of recent Crocodiles, Alligators, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page440"><span class="smaller">{440}</span></span>and Gavials is composed of twenty-six
  precaudal vertebrae (namely, nine cervical, fifteen thoracic and lumbar, two sacral), and about
  thirty-four to forty or more caudal vertebrae. Individual variations, including lop-sided
  attachment of the iliac bones, are by no means uncommon.</p>

  <p>The sternum remains cartilaginous. It consists of an anterior rhomboid portion, which carries
  the coracoids and two pairs of ribs, and a posterior longer and narrower portion formed by the
  median fusion of the next following five or six ribs. Posteriorly the sternum bifurcates, each
  half carrying two or three ribs, of which the last sometimes loses its proximal connexion, and
  thus appears as a xiphisternal process. Ventrally, upon the anterior part of the sternum lies the
  longitudinal, originally paired, episternum. The shoulder-girdle consists of the coracoids and the
  scapulae, which fuse with each other into one bony piece on each side. A pre-coracoid is indicated
  in fossil forms by a notch in the coracoid.</p>

  <p>The space between the posterior end of the sternum and the pubic bones is occupied by the
  so-called abdominal sternum, composed of seven pairs of ossifications, resting upon the ventral
  side of the rectus abdominis muscle. Each pair consists of two closely apposed pieces, while the
  right and left remain separate in the median line. The last pair is much stronger than the rest,
  is more deeply imbedded in the rectus muscle, and is loosely connected with the anterior margin of
  the two "pubic" bones.</p>

  <p>The limbs are built upon the typical terrestrial pentadactyle type, but were in the Jurassic
  species undoubtedly more adapted to swimming locomotion. The fore-limbs were conspicuously shorter
  and smaller than the hind-limbs, and it is only since Tertiary times that the difference has
  decreased to a great extent. Ulna and radius remain separate. The proximal row of carpal bones
  consists now of the ulnare and radiale, both strong and distinctly elongated. On the outer side,
  between ulna and ulnare, lies a pisiform bone. Upon the radiale follows a compound bone, often
  imperfectly ossified towards the median side, and consisting of the first distal carpal, the
  centrale, and the intermedium. The third, fourth, and fifth carpals are fused into one mass. The
  second distal carpal remains separate. All five fingers are present and well developed. The number
  of phalanges of the pollex is two, of <span class="pagenum" id="page441"><span
  class="smaller">{441}</span></span>the others three, four, four and three respectively. During the
  embryonic development the number of phalanges of the fourth and fifth finger increases
  temporarily, to as many as seven on the fourth, to five or six on the fifth finger. Before the
  young animal is hatched the numbers are reduced again, chiefly by fusion of adjoining phalanges.
  This hyperphalangeal condition, typical of Plesiosauri, Ichthyosauri, Cetacea, and several other
  absolutely aquatic animals, naturally suggests the descent of the present Crocodiles from more
  essentially aquatic ancestors, but hitherto no trace of supernumerary phalanges has been found in
  any Jurassic Eusuchia, nor in the Parasuchia and Pseudosuchia.</p>

  <p>The composition of the pelvis is difficult to understand. It consists in the adult stage of
  three separate bones, of which two only partake in the formation of the acetabulum. The broad
  ilium sends out two processes; the posterior and stronger articulates with the ischium, which
  sends out a short and stout process towards the anterior process of the ilium, enclosing a
  foramen. This process contains a separate centre of ossification, possibly homologous with the
  true pubis, while each club-shaped bone, loosely attached to it and directed forwards, generally
  called the pubis of the Crocodiles, would then be equivalent to an epipubis. Neither the "pubes"
  nor the ischia form a ventral median symphysis.</p>

  <p>The femur is devoid of a prominent inner trochanter. Tibia and fibula are of almost equal
  strength. The tarsal elements are, in the adult, reduced by fusion to five bones. The fibulare is
  transformed into a typically projecting, heel-shaped calcaneum, while the intermedium is fused
  with the tibiale into a broad astragalus. The first, second, and third distal tarsalia are much
  reduced towards the inner side, and form one wedge-shaped, partly cartilaginous mass. The fourth
  tarsale lies between the fibulare and the fourth metatarsal, while the fifth tarsale is
  hook-shaped and loosely attached to the outer side of the fourth. It has lost its metatarsal and
  the rest of the fifth finger. Embryos are hyperphalangeal, the fourth toe developing six
  phalanges, and there are traces of the fifth toe. The numbers are ultimately reduced to 2, 3, 4,
  4, 0 on the five toes. The fourth toe remains without a claw.</p>

  <p><b>Skin.</b>&ndash;The epidermal horny layer is not shed periodically nor in pieces; the wear
  and tear is made good imperceptibly. The <span class="pagenum" id="page442"><span
  class="smaller">{442}</span></span>scales, which cover the whole body, have a hard, horny,
  waterproof covering, but between them the skin is soft. Each scale of the sides, belly, and tail,
  and especially those of the lower jaw, shows a little dot or pit. At this spot the epidermis is
  not cornified or thickened, and a nerve with sensory corpuscles ends beneath the bottom of the
  pit. Sometimes these pits are filled with d&eacute;bris of cells, and on the lower jaw, especially on the
  chin, these organs, instead of forming pits, are raised into little wartlike prominences.</p>

  <p>The scutes or dermal portions of the scales consist of thickened, cutaneous connective tissue,
  and are more or less extensively ossified, thus forming a proper dermal armour. In most recent
  Crocodilia the armour is restricted to the back, with occasional osseous plates on the throat, as
  in <i>Osteolaemus</i>; regular although thin ossifications in the ventral scutes occur in the
  Caimans only. The Crocodile and Alligator skins of commerce consist entirely of the tanned cutis,
  minus the epidermis and the horny coverings of the scutes. In some fossil genera the ventral
  armour was extensively developed, especially in <i>Teleosaurus</i>, in some genera to the
  exclusion of dorsal ossifications. The armour of the recent forms consists, so far as the large
  scutes are concerned, of a considerable number of scutes, which are arranged in transverse rows,
  each row corresponding with one skeletal segment of the trunk proper. Mostly there is a detached
  cluster of scutes on the back of the neck. On the trunk some of the scutes are larger and more
  crested than others, and form in their totality a variable number of longitudinal rows. The median
  pair is generally the most conspicuous on the back. Some of the more lateral rows of keeled scutes
  converge more and more towards the tail, the inner rows drop out imperceptibly, and two lateral
  rows combine on the middle of the tail into an unpaired series of vertical blades. These are no
  longer bony, but show more strongly developed horny sheaths; they are very flexible, and transform
  the tail into an effective propelling organ.</p>

  <p>Most of the larger scutes and the upper surface of the bones of the skull have a peculiar
  gnawed-out, almost honeycombed appearance, as is usual wherever most of the cutis itself is
  transformed into bone or co-ossifies with underlying bone, while the uppermost layers and the
  horny layer of the epidermis are much reduced and thinned out.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page443"><span class="smaller">{443}</span></span></div>

  <p>All the recent Crocodilia possess two pairs of skin-glands, both secreting musk. One pair is
  situated on the throat, on the inner side of the right and left half of the lower jaw. The opening
  of the gland, visible from below (see the figure of <i>Crocodilus niloticus</i>, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page461">461</a></span>), is slit-like, and leads into a pocket, which in
  large specimens is of the size of a walnut; the bag is filled with a smeary pale brownish
  substance, a concentrated essence of musk, much prized by natives. The secretion is most active
  during the rutting time, when the glands are partly everted. My young Crocodiles and Alligators
  often turned them inside out, like the finger of a glove, when they were taken up and held by
  force. The other pair lies within the lips of the cloacal slit, and is not visible from the
  outside. The use of these strongly scented organs, which are possessed by both sexes, is obviously
  hedonic. The sexes are probably able to follow and find each other, thanks to the streak of
  scented water left behind each individual.</p>

  <p>The <b>tongue</b> is flat and thick, attached by its whole under-surface, so that it can be
  elevated but not protruded. It fills the whole space between the two halves of the lower jaw
  behind their symphysis. The dorsal surface shows numerous irregular polygonal fields, in the
  middle of most of which opens the duct of a large mucous gland. Tactile and gustatory corpuscles
  are scattered over the surface in the shape of tiny wartlike elevations. The hinder margin of the
  tongue is raised into a transverse fold, which, by meeting a similar fold from the palate, the
  velum palatinum, can shut off the mouth completely from the deep and wide cavity of the throat,
  which leads of course into the gullet. Dorsally the choanae open into this cavity; and since the
  narial passages are transformed into long tubes, completely surrounded by bone, Crocodiles can lie
  submerged in the water, with only the nostrils exposed and with the mouth open, and breathe
  without water entering the windpipe. The opening of the latter, the glottis, is a longitudinal
  slit, protected by the laryngeal cartilages, opened and closed by muscles. There is also a pair of
  membranous folds within the glottis, which serve as vocal cords. Ventrally below the larynx lies
  the cartilaginous, broad, shield-shaped hyoid; on the sides are attached the short hyoid horns.
  The <b>trachea</b> is long, consists of about sixty or more complete cartilaginous rings, and
  divides into two short bronchi, likewise protected by complete rings. The trachea is depressed;
  its transverse diameter decreases <span class="pagenum" id="page444"><span
  class="smaller">{444}</span></span>from the glottis backwards. The <b>lungs</b> have attained a
  high degree of efficiency. Each lung is an oval sac, and is transformed into a complicated system
  of tubes, at the end of which are the countless honeycomb-like respiratory cells, the whole lung
  being spongy. The main bronchus is continued straight down to the posterior end of the lung, and
  sends off during its course regular secondary bronchi, and these send off tertiary bronchi. The
  whole arrangement is very regular, the tubes coming off like rows of organ-pipes. Each lung hangs
  freely in the thoracic cavity. Besides its ventral attachment by its arteries, veins, and the
  bronchus, it is connected by loose tissue with the liver and the pericardial septum. Each half of
  the thoracic cavity is partitioned off from the abdominal cavity by a strong transverse mesenteric
  lamella. The partition between the lungs and the stomach is at first simple, it then divides, to
  enclose the liver; the anterior partition passing between liver and lung to the inner surface of
  the sternum; the posterior lamella between the liver and the stomach. Both meet on the ventral
  surface of the liver, and are continued into or attached to the peculiar "diaphragmatic" muscle.
  This is covered by the internal rectus muscle of the abdomen, arising from the last pair of
  abdominal ribs near the pubic bones; it is innervated by a branch of the last precrural nerve, and
  extends as a broad but thin muscular sheath (always within and unconnected with the abdominal
  wall) to the ventral posterior vein of the liver; thence it is continued as an aponeurosis,
  together with the peritoneal lamella mentioned above, to the inner surface of the sternum.
  Contraction of this singular muscle indirectly widens the pulmonary cavity, and thereby directly
  aids inspiration. It acts consequently like the diaphragm or midriff of Mammals, although it is
  morphologically an entirely different muscle.</p>

  <p>The <b>stomach</b> is smaller than one might expect from the fact that large Crocodiles can eat
  up nearly a whole man; but a great deal of their prey is stowed away preliminarily in the wide
  gullet until the rapid, powerful digestion, which dissolves every bone, makes room in the stomach.
  This consists of a wide, somewhat globular gizzard, rather muscular, with a pair of tendinous
  centres like those of birds, and a much smaller pyloric, globular, more glandular compartment. It
  leads into the duodenum, which is coiled up into a double loop, and receives at its end the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page445"><span class="smaller">{445}</span></span>hepatic and pancreatic
  ducts. The small intestine is narrow, and is stowed away in a few irregular coils; the rectum is
  wide; a caecum is absent.</p>

  <p>The <b>cloaca</b> is peculiar. The coprodaeum and urodaeum, cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page498">498</a></span>, are confluent, and form a wide, oval bag, closed in front and
  behind by strong sphincters, and it acts normally as a urinary receptacle. In the dorsal wall open
  the two ureters; a little towards the sides, and ventrally, open the two oviducts, on the right
  and left, near the base of the clitoris. Then follows a transverse, soft, muscular fold, which
  shuts off this cavity from the proctodaeum or outermost chamber. In the latter is stowed away the
  rather large copulatory organ. It arises out of the medio-ventral wall of the cloaca, and has a
  deep, longitudinal groove on its morphologically dorsal side for the conduction of the sperma, the
  vasa deferentia opening near its basal end. On either side of the root of this organ, in both
  sexes alike, opens a peritoneal canal, wide enough in large specimens to pass a goose-quill. The
  outer opening of the cloaca forms a longitudinal slit; within it, dorso-laterally, are the
  openings of the two anal musk-glands.</p>

  <p>The <b>kidneys</b> are much lobed. The testes are long and oval; the ovaries are much elongated
  and flat; and the eggs contained therein in great numbers are extremely small, except those which
  ripen during the time of propagation.</p>

  <p>The <b>vascular system</b> has attained the highest state of development of all reptiles. The
  heart is practically quadrilocular, the partition between the right and left ventricle being
  complete; but there is still a small communication, the foramen Panizzae, which lies in the middle
  of the wall common to both aortae, where they leave their respective ventricles. The left aortic
  arch conveys all the arterialised blood out of the left ventricle, and supplies head, neck, trunk,
  and tail. The right aortic arch, coming from the right ventricle, supplies venous blood, mixed
  with what little arterial blood it receives through the foramen Panizzae, to most of the viscera.
  On a level with the stomach both descending aortic arches are still connected with each other; the
  left aorta supplies most of the gut; the right, the trunk and the kidneys.</p>

  <p>The outer <b>ear</b> lies in a recess, dorsally overhung by the lateral edge of the bony
  squamoso-postfrontal bridge; and this <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span
  class="smaller">{446}</span></span>carries a flap of skin, provided with muscles, to close the ear
  tightly. The tympanic membrane is visible at the bottom of the recess; shining through it is part
  of that cartilage which is homologous with the malleus of the auditory ossicular chain; the
  outward extension of the latter on its way to the mandible, behind the joint, passes as a partly
  cartilaginous string through the slit-like hole which is visible at the back of the skull, between
  the quadrate and the latero-occipital wing.</p>

  <p>The <b>eyes</b> have, besides the lower and upper lid, a third, the nictitating membrane, which
  can be drawn over the front of the eyeball. In the upper lid lies a cup-shaped bony plate of
  variable size. The pupil contracts into a vertical slit. The iris is greenish.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 104.</span>&ndash;Map to illustrate the present
      distribution of Crocodilia.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The recent <b>geographical distribution</b> of the various kinds of Crocodilia loses its
  mystery when we recollect that during the Tertiary period Alligators, Crocodiles, and long-snouted
  Gavials existed in Europe. The solitary species of Alligator in China is the last living reminder
  of their former Periarctic distribution. The group, taken as a whole, is otherwise now
  intertropical, Crocodiles alone inhabiting the Palaeo-tropical region, together with long-snouted
  forms in the Oriental sub-region, while Alligators and Caimans, with a few Crocodiles, live in
  America.</p>

  <p>They are all rapacious, doing much damage by their predatory habits, and are fierce and sulky
  in temper. But the danger to man differs much in different countries. While Crocodiles are dreaded
  in some localities, they are in others considered almost harmless, and men swim through the
  haunted waters without hesitation. It seems as if certain old and wily individuals turn into
  man-eaters, just like tigers and lions.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page447"><span class="smaller">{447}</span></span></div>

  <p>Their home is the water, in which they pass the night, their time of hunting. The prey is
  either patiently watched or stalked, and nothing falls amiss. Water-birds are seized by the beast,
  which rises imperceptibly from below. Some species are said to make use of their powerful tails
  for hitting the victim and even jerking it into the mouth. The strength of their jaws is enormous,
  and they do not let go what they have seized, unless, in the case of a man, he has the presence of
  mind and the opportunity to dig his fingers into the monster's eyes whilst being dragged down.</p>

  <p>In the morning they crawl on to sandbanks, or on to logs of wood, which they closely resemble,
  in order to bask, mostly in such a position that on the slightest alarm they can plunge into the
  water. For this reason they frequently make a half circle before they settle down to rest, with
  the heads turned towards the river. There they bask all day long, apparently fast asleep, often
  with gaping mouths. But their sense of hearing and of sight is sharp, and they learn from
  experience, old individuals being by far the most wary. Commercially the skins are now of
  considerable value. The flesh is white, and is tolerable eating but for the combination of fishy
  and musky odour, which, although faint, is not to everybody's liking.</p>

  <p>All the species have a voice, a kind of loud, short bark or croak, heard at night and when
  angered. The female lays several dozen or even three score white, oval, hard-shelled eggs in the
  sand, well out of the reach of moisture; and some species construct an elaborate kind of nest. The
  mother watches it, takes care of and fights for her offspring, numbers of which fall an easy prey
  to large storks, fishes, and to the stronger members of their own kind.</p>

  <p>In the cooler countries they hibernate in the ground; and in hot countries, which are subject
  to drought, some kinds aestivate in the hardened mud; or they migrate. When during a prolonged
  drought on the island of Maraj&oacute;, at the mouth of the Amazon, the swamps and lakes were dried up,
  the Alligators migrated towards the nearest rivers, and many perished in the attempt. On one farm
  were found 8500 dead, and at the end of Lake Arary more than 4000. Such occurrences in bygone
  times may perhaps explain the masses of bones found here and there in a fossil state.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page448"><span class="smaller">{448}</span></span></div>

  <p>The age to which Crocodiles can live is quite beyond calculation. They are capable of
  propagation long before they are anything like half-grown, maybe at an age of little more than ten
  years; then they continue to grow perhaps for more than one hundred years, until they die.</p>

  <p>It is customary to divide the Eusuchia, most of which are extinct, into a longirostral and a
  brevirostral section. In the former the snout is much elongated and narrow, and the nasal bones,
  although they are sometimes very long, do not reach the nasal groove. The mandibular symphysis is
  very long, and is formed not only by the dentary but also by the splenial bones. In the
  brevirostral section the snout is shorter, sometimes broad and rounded off, and the nasal bones
  are supposed to reach the nasal groove, or at least to approach it very nearly; the mandibular
  symphysis is formed by the dentaries only. But these distinctions are quite arbitrary, and there
  exist all kinds of intermediate forms. For instance, in <i>Goniopholis</i> and
  <i>Diplocynodon</i>, which are both undoubtedly near allies of the recent Crocodiles and
  Alligators, the nasal bones are considerably removed from the nasal groove; and in <i>Crocodilus
  cataphractus</i> they are separated even from the premaxilla by the medio-dorsal suture of the
  maxillaries. Again, in <i>Goniopholis</i> the mandibular symphysis is so long that it comprises
  part of the splenial bones. Both typically long- and short-snouted forms occur already in the
  Upper Oolite, but in the Lower Jurassic age only long-snouted kinds seem to have existed. The
  latter cannot easily be connected with <i>Belodon</i>, one of the Parasuchia, on account of the
  position of the nostrils; the mere shortening of the long premaxillaries of <i>Belodon</i> would
  not transfer its distinctly paired nostrils to the anterior end of the premaxilla. To account for
  the position of the nasal groove in the Eusuchia, we have to go back to a primitive condition,
  such as that of the Pseudosuchian <i>A&euml;tosaurus</i>, and this consideration shows that the
  Parasuchia and Eusuchia are collateral branches.</p>

  <p>The Eusuchia have been split into many families. Zittel, for instance, divides them into ten,
  some of them on insufficient grounds, since there are too many intermediate forms; and more,
  sometimes quite unexpected, modifications are still being found. Several of the accepted families
  represent collateral or convergent lines of development.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There is the same tendency to transfer the choanae further back, owing to the
  formation of a solid secondary roofing in of the mouth, to transform the amphicoelous into
  procoelous vertebrae, to reduce the supratemporal foramina, and to obtain a better development of
  the dorsal armour, whilst that on the ventral side is gradually reduced. Lastly, there is a
  tendency towards a shortening and broadening of the snout, a condition which has reached its
  culmination in the Alligators, while the Gavials are survivals of another branch. The notches in
  the premaxilla, for the reception of some of the lower teeth, have also been acquired
  independently. Although the recent Crocodilia cannot now, as has been pointed out by Boulenger, be
  separated into different families, no valid diagnoses being possible owing to the existence of

  Greensand of Europe. Snout long and slender. The nasals are narrow, and so elongated that they
  meet a similar long extension of the premaxillaries. Choanae between the palatines and pterygoids.
  Vertebrae amphicoelous. Dermal armour consisting of two imbricating dorsal and eight ventral rows,
  e.g. <i>Pholidosaurus</i> of the English Wealden.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Gavialidae.</b>&ndash;Snout long and slender. The choanae are situated entirely
  within the pterygoids. Vertebrae procoelous. Members of this family make their first appearance in
  the littoral marine deposits of the Upper Chalk of Europe and North America; others are common in
  tertiary, marine, and freshwater deposits, whilst only two genera and species occur now in the
  Oriental sub-region.</p>

  <p><i>Thoracosaurus</i> in the Upper Chalk of New Jersey and France and Belgium is intermediate
  between <i>Gavialis</i> and <i>Tomistoma</i>. The prefrontal bones are very small, while the
  lacrymals are very long and surround the nasals posteriorly. The nasals themselves are slender,
  and reach the posterior likewise long and narrow prolongations of the premaxillaries.</p>

  <p><i>Gavialis.</i>&ndash;The snout is extremely long and slender. The mandibular symphysis is so
  long that it comprises a great portion of the splenial bones, and extends backwards almost to the
  level of the last teeth and to the palatal foramina. The nasal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page452"><span class="smaller">{452}</span></span>bones are very short, and are separated from
  the premaxillaries by the long suture of the maxillaries. About twenty-eight upper and twenty-five
  lower teeth on each side.</p>

  <p><i>G. gangeticus</i>, the only recent species, is essentially Indian, inhabiting chiefly the
  basins of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus; it occurs also in the Mahanadi of Orissa and in
  Arakan, but does not live in the Irrawaddy, nor in the Narbada, Kistna, and farther south. In
  spite of its great size, which reaches 20 feet or even more, it is harmless, and lives entirely
  upon fish; hence its Hindustani name, <i>gharial</i>, meaning fish-eater, of which the generic
  name is a corruption.</p>

  <p>The nuchal and dorsal scutes form a continuous shield, but there are two small postoccipital
  scutes. General colour, dark olive-brown above; the young are paler, with dark markings. The male
  is remarkable for several peculiarities. The nose is very much swollen, and can be inflated like a
  bag when the nostrils are closed. In connexion herewith, probably produced by the recoil of the
  air in the long narial passages towards the choanae or posterior nares, there is a pair of hollow
  globular swellings, in large specimens of the size of a goose's egg. The shell of these globes is
  formed by the dorsal wings of the palatine bones above the floor of the choanae, and they extend
  forwards to the right and left of the ethmoid almost to the vertical downward process of the
  prefrontals.</p>

  <p>Although the Gharial is common enough, we know next to nothing about its habits, and in
  zoological gardens it is rather rare. A. Anderson<a id="NtA_139"
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> has, however, made the following observations. Forty eggs were
  dug out of the sand, where they were <span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span
  class="smaller">{453}</span></span>lying in two tiers, twenty below and twenty above, with a foot
  of sand between. The young ran with amazing rapidity the moment they were hatched. Some of them
  actually bit his fingers before he had time to remove the shell from their bodies! The length of
  these new-born creatures was 15 to 16 inches, 9 of which belonged to the long and slender
  tail.</p>

  <p>Several fossil species have been described from the Pliocene deposits of the Sivalik Hills of
  India; and in the same district occurred the closely allied <i>Rhamphosuchus crassidens</i>, which
  reached the gigantic length of about 50 feet!</p>

  <p><i>Tomistoma.</i>&ndash;The general configuration of the skull and snout is that of
  <i>Gavialis</i>, but the nasal bones are long and reach the premaxillaries, although not the nasal
  groove, thereby separating the maxillaries. The first and fourth mandibular teeth fit into notches
  of the upper jaw, while most of the others fit into pits between the teeth of the upper jaw. About
  twenty upper and eighteen lower teeth on each side.</p>

  <p><i>T. schlegeli</i>, the only species, reaches a length of 15 feet; it inhabits the rivers and
  swamps of Borneo, Malacca, and Sumatra. Fossil specimens of <i>Tomistoma</i> have been found in
  the Miocene of Malta and Sardinia. <i>Gavialosuchus</i> of the Miocene of Hungary is closely
  allied.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Atoposauridae.</b>&ndash;The few members of this family, <i>Atoposaurus</i>,
  <i>Alligatorium</i>, and <i>Alligatorellus</i>, lived in the Upper Oolitic period of France, and
  were small, about one foot in length. The vertebrae are amphicoelous. The nasal groove is divided
  by a prolongation of the nasal bones. The head is short, and in its general shape rather like that
  of a lizard.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Goniopholidae</b>, in the Purbeck and Wealden of Europe and the corresponding level
  of North America. The vertebrae are amphicoelous. The choanae are still elongated but are situated
  between the palatines and pterygoids. The premaxillaries are rather large, and each sends a broad
  triangular process between the nasal and maxillary. The nasals are broad and are well separated
  from the nasal groove. The splenials help to form the mandibular symphysis.</p>

  <p><i>Goniopholis.</i>&ndash;The general configuration of the skull is rather like that of
  <i>Crocodilus vulgaris</i>. There is a pair of deep notches in the upper jaw for the reception of
  the lower canine teeth. <i>G. simus</i> and <i>G. crassidens</i> in England and continental
  Europe, and <span class="pagenum" id="page454"><span class="smaller">{454}</span></span>others in
  Colorado, were large-sized Crocodiles, some with a skull 2 feet in length. The dermal armour
  consisted of a pair of dorsal rows, a thoracic and an abdominal shield, composed as in the
  Teleosauridae of six to eight longitudinal sutured rows.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Crocodilidae.</b>&ndash;Beginning in the Upper Cretaceous period of Europe and North
  America, many forms of Crocodiles, Alligators, and Caimans existed in the Tertiary period in
  America, Europe, and India; persisting in Europe until the Plistocene. The vertebrae are
  procoelous. The choanae are completely surrounded by the pterygoids. The nasals reach the nasal
  groove, except in <i>Crocodilus cataphractus</i>. The orbits are larger than the small
  supratemporal fossae, and always continuous superficially with the lateral temporal fossae, the
  postfronto-jugal bridge not reaching the surface. The dorsal armour consists of more than one pair
  of longitudinal rows, while the ventral armour is much reduced in thickness or absent.</p>

  <p><i>Diplocynodon.</i>&ndash;Common in the Oligocene and Miocene of Europe, e.g. <i>D.
  hastingsiae</i>. The skull resembles that of the Alligators, but has a pair of lateral notches in
  the premaxilla for the reception of the third, and sometimes also of the fourth mandibular tooth.
  The ventral armour is still rather strong.</p>

  <p><i>Crocodilus.</i>&ndash;The fourth mandibular tooth fits, as a rule, into a notch in the upper
  jaw. The other teeth are more or less interlocked with those of the other jaw. The fifth upper
  tooth is the largest. The nasal bones form the posterior border of the nasal groove, but do not
  extend into it as a septum. The bony scutes of the dorsal shield are keeled, and stand closely
  together, being rarely united by suture; and they form from four to six principal rows.</p>

  <p>Crocodiles have occurred since the Upper Chalk in Europe; many species existed in the Tertiary
  epoch in Europe and North America, decreasing in numbers in the Pliocene and disappearing with the
  beginning of the Plistocene. About ten recent species are known, and these have now a somewhat
  scattered distribution; namely, three species in Africa, one of them extending into Syria; three
  in tropical America and the West Indian Islands; the rest in the Malay, Indian, and North
  Australian countries.</p>

  <p><i>C. palustris.</i>&ndash;The "Mugger" of India. The premaxillo-maxillary suture is
  transverse, as in the Alligators. The adults <span class="pagenum" id="page455"><span
  class="smaller">{455}</span></span>retain the five teeth in each half of the premaxilla. The
  mandibular symphysis is short, extending only to the level of the fourth or fifth tooth. The snout
  is stout, rather broad; the top of the head is rough but without any ridges. The upper and lower
  jaw each contain nineteen teeth on either side. The nuchal scutes, six in number, are packed
  closely together, the four biggest forming a square. Four smaller scutes are arranged in a curved
  line on the occiput. The dorsal shield is composed of four, sometimes of six rows of larger
  scutes, of which the central pair is the broadest. The fingers are webbed at the base; the outer
  toes are broadly webbed, and the outer edge of the hind-limbs is turned into a serrated fringe.
  The general colour of the upper parts is dark olive-brown; the young are pale, with black spots.
  The length of twelve feet is considered a fair average size for a large specimen.</p>

  <p>This, the "Marsh Crocodile," has a wide distribution. It inhabits the rivers, ponds, tanks, and
  marshes of India and Ceylon, extending eastwards through Burma and Malacca into most of the Malay
  islands, westwards into Beluchistan. This species is frequently venerated by the Hindoos, and is
  kept in a kind of domesticated condition, attended by fakirs. One of the most famous crocodile
  ponds, the so-called "mugger-peer," lies in an oasis of the sandy stretches to the north-west of
  Karachi. A. L. Adams has described a visit to this pond.<a id="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"The greater pond is about 300 yards in circumference, and contains many little grassy islands,
  on which the majority of the Crocodiles were then basking; some were asleep on its slimy sides,
  others half submerged in the muddy water, while now and then a huge monster would raise himself
  upon his diminutive legs, and waddling for a few paces, fall flat on his belly. Young ones, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page456"><span class="smaller">{456}</span></span>from a foot in length and
  upwards, ran nimbly along the margin of the pond, disappearing suddenly in the turbid waters as
  soon as we approached. The largest crocodile lives in a long narrow tank separated from the
  others. The fakirs, and natives who worship in the neighbouring temples, have painted his forehead
  red; they venerate the old monster, making a salaam to his majesty whenever he shows himself above
  water. A handsome young Beloochee, whose occupation it was to feed the animals, informed us that
  this specimen was upwards of 200 years old, and that by way of a 'tit-bit' he was in the habit of
  devouring the young crocodiles. During our visit this enormous brute was asleep on the bank of his
  dwelling-place, and seemed quite indifferent to our presence, although we came within a foot of
  him, and even attempted to arouse him by rubbing his nose with a leg of goat's flesh, which,
  however, a young one greedily seized. Our attendant tried in vain to excite their ferocity, but
  beyond a feeble attempt to snap their trenchant teeth, the animals showed no disposition to attack
  us.</p>

  <p>"A pony was wading about in the pond and feeding on the grassy hillocks, but the crocodiles
  took no notice of him.</p>

  <p>"The crocodiles dig deep in the sand, under the neighbouring date-trees, and there deposit
  their eggs. Quantities of deciduous teeth, of various sizes, were strewn along the slimy sides of
  the pond.</p>

  <p>"Strangers are expected to stand treat, not only by the fakirs and natives, who gain a
  livelihood by hanging about the pond and showing the monsters, but even the crocodiles themselves
  seem to anticipate a feast, and on the arrival of a party come out in unusual numbers.
  Accordingly, we had a goat slaughtered, during which operation the brutes seemed to rouse
  themselves, as if preparing for a rush. Then our guide, taking piece after piece of the flesh,
  dashed it on the bank, uttering a low growling sound, at which the whole tank became in motion,
  and crocodiles, of whose existence we had been before ignorant, splashed through the shallow
  water, struggling which would seize the prize. The shore was literally covered with scaly
  monsters, snapping their jaws at one another."</p>

  <p>Sir J. Emerson Tennent<a id="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> has had many
  opportunities of studying the habits of the Marsh Crocodile. According to him <span
  class="pagenum" id="page457"><span class="smaller">{457}</span></span>it is essentially cowardly
  in its instincts, and hastens to conceal itself on the approach of man. One of these creatures,
  which was overtaken in the jungle by a gentleman riding on horseback, fled to a shallow pool, and
  thrusting its head into the mud till it covered up its eyes, remained motionless, in profound
  confidence of perfect concealment.</p>

  <p>"There is a popular belief that the crocodile is exceedingly sensitive to tickling, and that it
  will relax its hold of a man if he can only contrive to reach and rub with his hand the softer
  parts of its under side. An incident of some reality in this piece of folk-lore came under my own
  observation. One morning ... we came suddenly upon a crocodile asleep under some bushes of the
  buffalo-thorn, several hundred yards from the water. The terror of the poor wretch was extreme
  when it awoke and found itself discovered and completely surrounded. It was a hideous creature,
  upwards of 10 feet long.... It started to its feet and turned round in a circle, hissing and
  clanking its bony jaws, with its ugly green eye intently fixed upon us. On being struck with a
  stick, it lay perfectly quiet and apparently dead. Presently it looked cunningly round, and made a
  rush towards the water, but on a second blow it lay again motionless and feigning death. We tried
  to rouse it, but without effect; pulled its tail, slapped its back, struck its hard scales, and
  teased it in every way, but all in vain; nothing would induce it to move till, accidentally, my
  son, then a boy of twelve years old, tickled it gently under the arm, and in an instant it drew
  the limb close to its side and turned to avoid a repetition of the experiment. Again it was
  touched under the other arm, and the same emotion was exhibited, the great monster twisting about
  like an infant to avoid being tickled."</p>

  <p>In the dry season, when the tanks become exhausted, the Marsh Crocodiles have occasionally been
  encountered in the jungle, wandering in search of water. During a severe drought, in 1844, they
  deserted a tank near Kornegalle, and traversed the town during the night, on their way to another
  reservoir in the suburb; two or three fell into the wells; others, in their trepidation, laid eggs
  in the street, and some were found entangled in garden fences and killed.</p>

  <p>Generally, however, during the extreme drought, when unable to procure their ordinary food from
  the drying up of the <span class="pagenum" id="page458"><span
  class="smaller">{458}</span></span>watercourses, they bury themselves in the mud and remain in a
  state of torpor till released by the recurrence of rains.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>C. porosus</i> s. <i>biporcatus</i>.&ndash;The premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate
  does not form a transverse line, but is <span class="sans fwb">W</span>-shaped, and extends
  backwards as in the rest of the species of Crocodiles to be described. This Indian species is
  easily recognised by the prominent longitudinal ridge which extends in front of each eye, over the
  prefrontal bones, and by the absence of sub-occipital scutes. The nuchal scutes consist of four
  large ones, which form a square, and one or two smaller scutes on each side. The dorsal shield
  contains four to eight principal longitudinal rows. The digits, webs, and the serrated fringe of
  the legs are like those of <i>C. palustris</i>. The head and snout, however, are distinctly
  longer, and more slender in proportion, and the adult has only four teeth in each premaxilla. The
  general colour is dark olive-brown. Young specimens, as usual, are much paler and are spotted with
  black.</p>

  <p>This species attains a much larger size than the Marsh Crocodile. Specimens of 15 to 20 feet in
  length are not uncommon, and there is a record of one monster of 33 feet. Consequently this is,
  both in bulk and length, undoubtedly the largest species of recent reptiles. It is essentially an
  inhabitant of tidal waters or estuaries, frequently entering salt water and going out to sea.
  Herewith corresponds its wide distribution, namely, the whole coast of the Gulf of Bengal,
  extending to <span class="pagenum" id="page459"><span class="smaller">{459}</span></span>Southern
  China, and across the Malay Archipelago to the northern coasts of Australia. Eastwards it ranges
  to the Solomon Islands and even to Fiji. Curiously enough, it does not seem to occur on the west
  coast of India.</p>

  <p>According to Tennent it is ready to assail man when pressed by hunger, and the same authority
  mentions the following serio-comic incident. A man was fishing, seated on the branch of a tree
  overhanging the water, and to shelter himself from the drizzling rain he covered his head and
  shoulders with a bag folded into a shape common with the natives. While in this attitude, a
  leopard sprang upon him from the jungle, but missing its aim, seized the bag and not the man, and
  fell with it into the river. Here a crocodile, which had been eyeing the angler in despair, seized
  the leopard as it fell, and sank with it to the bottom.</p>

  <p>I have had some personal experience in the bringing up of the young of this species. Two dozen
  of them had come from Ceylon when quite young, only one foot long. At first they were very shy,
  and huddled together in their tank, but they took food greedily&ndash;strips of fish and, later
  on, sheep's heart. When frightened they emitted peculiar, high-pitched, half-croaking sounds. Some
  of them snapped at the finger when touched; others were of a more gentle disposition; the shy ones
  were undoubtedly the most vicious. Within one year they grew to 18 or 20 inches, and added much to
  their bulk. Then they were transferred to a deeper and larger tank in a greenhouse, in which they
  could roam about at liberty. In the daytime they dozed on the margins of their pond, mostly in
  such a position that, at the slightest alarm, they could plunge back into the water. The strongest
  specimen left the tank entirely, and took up its favourite place for basking on the stump of a
  tree, to reach which it had to climb up a rough wall of stones. After three years, several had
  grown to the length of three and a half, and even four feet, and had by this time become
  formidable pets. Although handled frequently, they never became tame, the only change in their
  behaviour being that, instead of rushing off in a fright, and hiding for half an hour at the
  bottom of the tank, they became more vicious and confident, making for and snapping at the hand
  which fed them. The nights were spent regularly in the water, either floating <span
  class="pagenum" id="page460"><span class="smaller">{460}</span></span>with just the nostrils
  exposed, or in search of food, frogs being their favourite prey, while their main sustenance
  consisted of "lights," with an occasional mouse, or a piece of solid meat by way of an
  <i>entr&eacute;e</i>. Small pieces were bolted. The tough "lights," namely lungs with the windpipe and
  blood-vessels, were causes of great quarrels. Two or three would get hold of a lump of this kind,
  tearing at it, and twisting and rolling over in opposite directions. The supply of warm water came
  through a stout pipe of red india-rubber, and this was an irresistible attraction to the
  crocodiles. On many a morning the tube was found twisted into a knot, one of the creatures having
  spent hours in chewing it and in trying to wrench it off. In order to aid digestion they swallowed
  pebbles. The most favourable temperature of the water was 85&deg; F.; if below 75&deg; F. they refused to
  eat, but a continued exposure to 60&deg; F. did not hurt them. When the temperature rose above 95&deg; F.
  they left the water, although means had to be taken to prevent them from lying on the hot-water
  pipes.</p>

  <p><i>C. niloticus</i> s. <i>vulgaris</i>.&ndash;The premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate is

  behind, and there is a row of smaller pieces across the occiput. The dorsal shield contains six to
  eight principal longitudinal rows. The fingers are webbed at the base; the outer toes are very
  broadly webbed; and there is a serrated fringe on the outer side of the leg. The general colour of

  <p>The Nile Crocodile is essentially African, ranging from the Senegal to the Cape and to Egypt.
  It is also very common in Madagascar. Nothing is known about its occurrence in Arabia, but a few
  specimens of rather small size seem still to exist in Syria, in the Wadi Zerka, an eastern
  tributary of the Jordan.</p>

  <p>Even in historical times the Crocodile must have been very common in lower Egypt, to judge from
  the number of mummies preserved by the old Egyptians. Now it is practically exterminated, and
  there are scarcely any left below Wadi Halfa.</p>

  <p>Such a conspicuous and dangerous creature has naturally always enjoyed notoriety. It is well
  described in one of the oldest writings of the world, the Book of Job. "Canst thou draw out
  leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?... His scales are his
  pride, shut up together as with a close seal. One is so near to another, that no air can come
  between them. They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be
  sundered.... Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more." Bows and arrows, spears
  and clubs, are of little avail against such a <span class="pagenum" id="page462"><span
  class="smaller">{462}</span></span>monster; the dragging out of a hooked, full-grown specimen
  requires many men and is a formidable task. Of course firearms have changed all this, and its
  invulnerability to bullets is nonsense. It is true that a bullet sent into the head is generally
  ineffective, since it is a hundred to one that the bullet does not hit the small brain, and even
  if it does, the creature sinks to the bottom and is lost to view until decomposition sets in and
  the gases developing in the body cause it to float.</p>

  <p>Herodotus has quaint stories about these crocodiles and their worship. Amongst other stories he
  mentions that the bird <i>Trochilus</i>, supposed to be the <i>Pluvianus aegyptius</i>, a kind of
  Plover, slips into the gaping mouth to pick off the leeches which infest the reptile's gums. "In
  Egypt it is called Champsa, but the Ionians call them <span title="kokodriloi"
  class="fsn">&kappa;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&delta;&rho;&#x03AF;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;</span> on
  account of the resemblance to the lizards which live on their garden walls." This is in fact the
  origin of the name crocodile, <span title="kordylos"
  class="fsn">&kappa;&#x03CC;&rho;&delta;&upsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> being the ancient
  Greek for lizard and newt. With reduplication <span title="korkordylos"

  The Arabic name is <i>ledschun</i>.</p>

  <p>The story about the Plover seems to be true. These birds are sometimes seen sitting upon
  basking crocodiles, and since the latter are in the habit of resting, perhaps half asleep, with
  the mouth wide open, it is possible that these agile birds do pick their teeth, and that they,
  being also very watchful, by their own cry of warning and by fluttering off on the approach of
  danger, give the alarm to the crocodiles and thus benefit them in more than one way.</p>

  <p>But the equally old story about the Ichneumon or Mongoose is an idle invention. Mongooses are
  partial to eggs, but they certainly prefer those of hens and other birds to those of the
  crocodile, which are far too hard and strong to be broken by such a little animal. Moreover, as we
  shall see presently, the eggs are far too well concealed.</p>

  <p>The best account of the habits of these crocodiles is the one given recently by Voeltzkow,<a
  id="NtA_142" href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> who has spent a long time in Madagascar to
  collect material for the study of their development.</p>

  <p>He says that <i>C. niloticus</i> is not only the most common reptile, but perhaps the most
  common vertebrate in Madagascar. <span class="pagenum" id="page463"><span
  class="smaller">{463}</span></span>It occurs in every pool and river in great numbers, especially
  upon the sandbanks of the Betsiboka River, where one may see more than one hundred within one
  hour's paddling down stream. The largest specimen measured by Voeltzkow was 13 feet long; the
  largest in the National Collection is a little less than 15 feet.</p>

  <p>The crocodiles are caught in various ways. The simplest apparatus consists of two pointed
  sticks, which are fastened cross-wise within the bait to which is attached a rope, and this is
  made fast on the bank of the river or lake. The animal, when it has once swallowed this spiked
  bait, keeps its jaws firmly closed, so that it can be dragged out of the water. Another method is
  more reliable. A long and strong rope is made into an easily slipping noose, with an opening of
  about 18 inches. The bait is attached to the upper part of the noose, while the lower portion is
  kept open by a springy branch, the whole thing being so balanced that it will float upright. When
  a crocodile seizes the bait, which it does with a side jerk of the head, the branch falls out of
  the noose and the latter closes around the upper or lower jaw.</p>

  <p>These crocodiles dig long subterranean passages of 30 to 40 feet in length; the passage opens
  in the bank below the level of the water, and gradually ascending ends in a somewhat wider
  compartment, which allows the creature to turn round. Two or three air-holes are pierced through
  the ceiling of the burrow, in which bones and other remains of food are often found, so that the
  natives' belief, that the crocodiles retire into these chambers in order to devour their prey in
  undisturbed secrecy, appears very probable. When suddenly disturbed or frightened they take to
  these lairs, and since their position is clearly marked by the air-holes, the natives block the
  passage and then dig the animal out from above.</p>

  <p>Eggs are laid, in Madagascar, from the end of August to the end of September; the number of one
  set varies from twenty to thirty. They are deposited in a nest. This is in the ground, mostly in
  white sand, and consists of a hollow 18 inches to 2 feet deep. The walls are rather vertical, but
  near the bottom they are undermined, and here the eggs are placed. The centre of the pit being
  somewhat higher, the eggs roll by themselves into the undermined peripheral region. The laying
  takes place <span class="pagenum" id="page464"><span class="smaller">{464}</span></span>during the
  night, mostly a little before daybreak. After one half of the eggs has been laid, they are covered
  up with sand, whereupon the other half is deposited. Then the hole is completely filled up and no
  visible traces are left behind; but the mother sleeps upon the nest and thus leads to its
  discovery. The position of the nest is so chosen that it cannot be reached by moisture from below;
  the eggs are most susceptible to moisture, a very slight amount of which causes them to turn
  bad.</p>

  <p>The shape of the eggs of one and the same clutch varies much, some being elliptical, others
  cylindrical with rounded off ends. Their size varies from 5.5 to 9 cm. in length, and 4 to 5 cm.
  in width. The shell is white and glossy, thick and hard, either roughly granular or smooth. They
  are hatched in about twelve weeks.</p>

  <p>Voeltzkow feels certain that the mother returns to the nest at the proper time in order to dig
  the young ones out and to conduct them to the water. To test this story he had a nest surrounded
  with a fence; the mother returned several times and partly destroyed the fence, which was then
  replaced by a stronger one. One day, when the young had been hatched, the nest was found to be
  filled with sand, the shells and one dead little crocodile being at the bottom of the hole. The
  mother had dug a deep ditch below the fence, but had not succeeded in reaching the nest, although
  she had received and conducted her offspring away. As a rule, when the young are hatched, the sand
  and the shells are found to be scraped out of the nest. The mother is probably warned by the
  hiccough-like sound which the young emit while still within the unbroken shell. Voeltzkow heard
  them piping from the other end of his room, the eggs being covered with a layer of sand two feet
  high. The sounds were heard when he walked past the nest, or knocked against the box. Possibly the
  young hear the mother when she retires to the nest to sleep on it, and give her warning to remove
  the eggs out of the groove. However, they do not break the shell until several days later.</p>

  <p>The hatching is not caused by the rainy season, since it took place a fortnight before the
  first showers. The "egg-tooth" of the newly hatched young is 0.5 to 0.75 mm. high, bicuspid, and
  acts like a borer or auger. It is still visible on the tip of the upper jaw, in front of the nose,
  when the creature is two weeks old. The <span class="pagenum" id="page465"><span
  class="smaller">{465}</span></span>newly hatched crocodile is of an astonishing size, so that it
  is rather puzzling to understand how it was stowed away in the egg. For instance, an egg of 8 cm.
  length and 5 cm. width, sends forth a crocodile 28 cm. or 11 inches in length. Even at this early
  age they snap at the finger.</p>

  <p>The egg is covered by a hard shell, within which is a thicker outer and a thinner inner
  membrane. The "white" is jelly-like, sometimes of a greenish tinge, and is so consistent that it
  will not flow. The yolk is round, and so large that it nearly reaches the shell-membrane in the
  short diameter. The yolk itself is surrounded by a very thin but strong membrane.</p>

  <p>The embryo begins to develop long before the egg is laid. When laid the germ is about 4 mm.
  long and shows about twelve somites. The cephalic bend begins at the end of the second week, the
  tail grows longer and the embryo becomes curled up. At the end of the third week it measures 10
  mm. in a straight line from brain to vent. The limbs begin to bud in the fourth week. With the
  sixth week the final shape begins to reveal itself, and is completed at the age of eight weeks;
  but a third month is necessary to ripen the embryo.</p>

  <p><i>C. cataphractus</i> is the Common Crocodile of West Africa, from the Senegal to the Congo.
  In opposition to <i>C. niloticus</i> it does not enter brackish water. It is easily recognised by
  the very slender snout, which rather resembles that of the Gavial; but the mandibular symphysis,
  although extending to the level of the eighth tooth, does not reach the splenial bones. The
  premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate is not transverse, but extends backwards. In conformity
  with the length of the snout the maxillaries meet in the dorso-medial line behind the nasal
  opening, thus excluding the nasals from the latter. The nuchal scutes consist of two large pairs,
  almost in contact with the dorsals, six of which form the principal longitudinal rows. The gular
  and ventral scutes ossify in the adult, hence the specific name. The fingers and toes are slightly
  webbed. General colour above, dark olive-brown; yellowish below. The young are olive with large
  black spots.</p>

  <p>The natives of the Lower Congo catch the crocodiles with two pointed sticks tied together
  cross-wise, surrounded with entrails by way of a bait. The whole is fastened to a pole or a strong
  rope and thrown into the river; and a narrow line, with a float <span class="pagenum"
  id="page466"><span class="smaller">{466}</span></span>attached to the cross-sticks, indicates the
  whereabouts of the crocodile when it has taken the bait and has sunk to the bottom.</p>

  <p><i>C. johnstoni</i>, of Northern Australia and Northern Queensland, and <i>C. intermedius</i>,
  of the Orinoko, are allied to <i>C. cataphractus</i>, at least so far as the configuration of the
  bones of the slender and long snout is concerned. The former is small, scarcely reaching the
  length of 7 feet, while the South American species grows to 13 feet.</p>

  <p><i>C. americanus</i> s. <i>acutus</i>.&ndash;This species, which inhabits the West Indian
  Islands, being there the only representative of the order, occurs also in Florida, and extends
  through the warmer parts of Central America into Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. Its
  characteristic feature is a median ridge or swelling on the snout. The length and relative width
  of the latter varies considerably. The maxillaries sometimes meet dorsally, or they remain
  separated by the narrow nasals, which in this case reach the posterior corner of the nasal groove.
  The nuchal scutes vary likewise; there being often a smaller pair on the side of and another
  behind the four principal scutes, which, as usual, form a square. A transverse row of little
  suboccipital scutes is also common. Largest size about 12 feet long.</p>

  <p><i>Osteolaemus tetraspis</i> s. <i>frontatus</i>.&ndash;The only species of this genus inhabits
  the rivers of the west coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone to the Ogowai. It differs from
  <i>Crocodilus</i> chiefly by the bony septum of the nasal groove, produced by forward extension of
  the nasal bones. The snout is rather short and stout; the upper surface very rugose and deeply
  pitted, but without ridges. The gular and ventral scutes are ossified, hence the generic name.
  Total length about 5 feet.</p>

  <p><i>Alligator.</i>&ndash;The fourth mandibular tooth fits into a pit in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page467"><span class="smaller">{467}</span></span>the upper jaw, and this pit is in some adult
  specimens transformed into a hole, the tip of the tooth appearing on the upper surface through the
  perforation. Most of the other teeth of the lower jaw are overlapped by those of the upper jaw.
  The number of teeth on either side amounts to seventeen to twenty in the upper and eighteen to
  twenty in the lower jaw. The nasal bones form not only the posterior border of the nasal groove,
  but they divide the latter by a median bony septum. The dorsal shield is formed by six or eight
  longitudinal series of keeled bony scutes, which, although standing close together, do not
  articulate with each other. Ossification of the gular and ventral scutes is absent or very
  slight.</p>

  <p>Alligators occur in the fluviatile deposits of the age of the Upper Chalk in Europe, where they
  did not die out until the Pliocene age; they are now restricted to two species, one in the
  Southern States of North America, the other in China.</p>

  <p><i>A. mississippiensis.</i>&ndash;The much-depressed and broadly rounded snout bears some
  resemblance to that of a pike, hence the now discarded specific name of <i>lucius</i>. The neck is
  protected by two pairs of large scutes, which form a square, interrupted in the middle line, with
  a pair of small scutes in front and another behind. Of the eighteen transverse dorsal rows of
  scutes eight are broad and prominent. The fingers are about half webbed, the outer toes about
  two-thirds webbed. The general colour is greenish black or dark brown above, yellowish below.
  Young specimens have yellowish cross-bands on a darker brown ground.</p>

  <p>The Alligator's northern limit is the mouth of the river Neuss in North Carolina, 35&deg; N. lat.
  From this point they abound near the mouths of all the creeks and rivers as far south as the Rio
  Grande, ascending the Mississippi to the entrance of the Red River in 33&deg; 50' N. lat.</p>

  <p>The habits and the embryology of the American Alligator have been described by S. F. Clarke,<a
  id="NtA_143" href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> who gives the following vivid and minute
  account:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"Usually one finds them in the waters of the smaller streams and ponds, lying with only the tip
  of the nose and the eyes exposed, or lying on an exposed place on the bank where the grass and
  other plants are beaten down, and the black, rich mud of the river bank is smoothed by the
  repeated movements of the <span class="pagenum" id="page468"><span
  class="smaller">{468}</span></span>alligators in climbing up and down. There they bask in the
  sunlight until disturbed by the hunter or the desire for food. When aroused they make for the
  bottom, and I have never waited long enough to see one return unless he were vigorously stimulated
  with a long pole. They frequently dig a cave for themselves in the bottom of the pond or stream,
  or in the bank beneath the water. Oftentimes one can start them out of the cave by using a pole,
  but if very obstinate, the hunters dig them out with spades.</p>

  <p>"As the water decreases in the streams and ponds with the summer heat, the alligators travel to
  the larger bodies of water. <span class="pagenum" id="page469"><span
  class="smaller">{469}</span></span>During the breeding season, from the end of May to the
  beginning of July, the males are very active, wandering about to various ponds and rivers in
  search of the females. Fierce battles are said to take place during this time between the excited
  males; and the mutilated specimens that one sees are weighty evidence for the truth of this
  assertion.... It is in the breeding season also that their bellowing is mostly heard, and more in
  the night than during the day. I have frequently heard them, while lying in the swamps at night,
  when they were in ponds fully a mile distant.</p>

  <p>"The largest specimen I saw measured 12 feet in length; and none of the many hunters and other
  natives of Florida I have met have seen any longer than 13 feet. All the hunters agree that it is
  only the males that acquire the great size; no one had ever seen a female that measured over 8
  feet, and the majority are not over seven.</p>

  <p>"The male has a heavier, more powerful head, and during the breeding season especially is more
  brilliantly coloured. The more brilliant colour occurs in patches and streaks on the sides of the
  head and body; it is generally a light yellow, or even whitish, and on one large male I saw a
  fairly bright red spot over each eye.</p>

  <p>"The alligators are rapidly diminishing in numbers under the stimulus of the high prices
  offered to the hunters for their hides. Both Whites and Indians make increasing war upon them.
  Several thousand skins were brought into the little station of Fort Pierce in 1890. The pioneers
  and settlers always destroy the nests and eggs, because the alligators eat their pigs; and the
  cleaned eggs and young alligators are sold by hundreds in the curio shops farther north. As their
  numbers diminish in Florida it is noticed that the Moccasin snakes increase. In Louisiana also the
  alligators are disappearing; and there the musk-rats are at the same time increasing, and are
  doing much damage by burrowing in the levees along the Mississippi. While the alligator can make a
  very stout fight, I have never seen one offer fight if there was any chance of retreat. They never
  offered to molest us, even when we waded through the ponds where they were.</p>

  <p>"The nest of the alligator is very large, and is built by the female. A great quantity of dead
  leaves and twigs, together with <span class="pagenum" id="page470"><span
  class="smaller">{470}</span></span>much of the finely divided humus underlying them, is scraped
  together into a low mound about 3 feet high; this varies considerably in its other dimensions,
  being in some instances 8 feet in diameter at the base. The nests are built on the bank of a
  stream or pool, and the female digs a cave under water in the bank close to the nest. Careful
  examination, of the largest nest found showed a root of a neighbouring palmetto-tree, nearly an
  inch in diameter, running through it at about a foot above the ground; there were also roots of a
  grape vine growing near, which extended nearly through the nest. This furnishes strong support to
  the statement of many of the hunters, that the nests are used for more than one season. I could
  get no evidence whatever that the nests are used more than once a year.</p>

  <p>"The eggs are laid near the top of the nest, within 8 inches of the surface, are four or five
  layers deep, and have no regular arrangement or uniform position of their axes in relation to the
  nest. The number of eggs to a nest varies from twenty to thirty, and averages twenty-eight; the
  maximum found was forty-seven.</p>

  <p>The eggs are white, elliptical, and vary in length from 50 to 90 mm. or 2 to 3&frac12; inches, and in
  the shorter diameter from 28 to 45 mm. Generally there is only slight variation in the eggs of one
  nest, but occasionally a nest is found in which most of the eggs are about the average size, while
  from two to five are very much smaller.</p>

  <p>"The shell is much rougher than that of a hen's egg, and much thicker. The shell membrane
  consists of an outer and an inner layer, in both of which the fibres are arranged spirally about
  the egg, but at right angles to one another.</p>

  <p>"The white of the egg has the consistency of a very thick jelly, is very clear and transparent,
  and is so firm that the whole egg, when perfectly fresh, may be turned out of the shell and shell
  membrane, and transferred from one hand to the other without breaking, and with but slight change
  of form. The white lies mostly at either end of the shell, but extends also in a thin layer
  between the yolk and the sides of the shell. The yolk holds a median position in the egg, is
  spherical, of a very light pale yellow, and so large that it almost touches the shell membrane
  about the midline."</p>

  <p>According to Holbrook the young as soon as they are disengaged from the shell seek the water
  and shift for themselves, <span class="pagenum" id="page471"><span
  class="smaller">{471}</span></span>the parents taking no care of them, though they may remain for
  some weeks in the same locality. In the spring and early summer months, and during the time of
  incubation, and especially on cloudy days or in the evening, alligators make a great noise; their
  croak is not unlike that of the bullfrog, but louder and less prolonged. On the approach of winter
  they select holes in the ground, where they remain torpid until spring. In this state of
  hibernation many are dug out by the negroes, who esteem the tail as an article of food.</p>

  <p><i>A. sinensis</i>.&ndash;The first intimation of the existence of a Crocodilian in the
  Yang-tse-kiang was made by Swinhoe in 1870, but it was not until nine years later that Fauvel<a
  id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> described the creature as <i>A. sinensis</i>. The
  same gentleman gave also an exhaustive account of the former records of this species in Chinese
  literature. According to Boulenger its nearest ally is <i>A. mississippiensis</i>, but it
  approaches the Caimans by the presence of ossifications in the ventral shields, which
  ossifications are, however, wide apart from each other. There are three pairs of large nuchal
  scutes in contact in the median line, besides smaller scutes in front of the nuchals and behind
  the occiput. The dorsal shield contains six rows of larger scutes. The fingers are not webbed. The
  general colour is greenish black above, speckled with yellow; greyish below. Total length only
  about six feet.</p>

  <p><i>Caiman</i>.&ndash;The five species of this genus, confined to Central America or to the East
  Andesian parts of South America, resemble the Alligators in most features, but differ from them in
  the following points. The nasals, although bordering the nasal groove, do not form a bony nasal
  septum. The supratemporal fossae are very small; or closed up, as in <i>C. trigonatus</i> and
  <i>C. palpebrosus</i> of Guiana. The ventral armour is composed of overlapping bony scutes, each
  of which is formed of two parts united by a suture.</p>

  <p><i>C. sclerops</i> has the widest distribution, from Southern Mexico to the northern half of
  Argentina. The upper eyelid is rugose, although only incompletely ossified, and is often more or
  less produced into a small horn. <i>C. niger</i> has flat upper eyelids.</p>

  <p class="sp5">According to Bates, Caimans exist in myriads in the waters of the Upper Amazons.
  One species, <i>C. trigonatus</i>, the <i>Jacar&eacute;-tinga</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page472"><span class="smaller">{472}</span></span>of the natives, reaches only six feet in
  length and has a slender muzzle and a black-banded tail. Another species, <i>C. niger</i>, the
  <i>Jacar&eacute;-nassu</i> or large Caiman, attains an enormous bulk and a length of 20 feet. They
  migrate annually, retreating to the flooded forests in the wet season and descending to the main
  rivers in the dry season.</p>

  <div class="bq1 itp05 fine sp1 divsp5">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Mesozoic aquatic reptiles, with two pairs of pentadactyle limbs, firmly fixed
    quadrate bones, single temporal arches, numerous alveolar teeth, and ribs which articulate only
    with the centra of the biconcave vertebrae.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Plesiosauria comprise the Mesosauri, Nothosauri, and Plesiosauri in an ascending order of
  development, which concerns especially the changes from a semi-terrestrial to an absolutely
  aquatic life;&ndash;elongation of the neck with corresponding shortening of the tail, and the
  gradual transformation of the limbs into hyperphalangeal paddles.</p>

  <p>The skull varies considerably in length. Seen from above it shows the nostrils, orbits, very
  large supratemporal foramina, and the interparietal hole. The nostrils lie rather far back, in
  front of the orbits, between the elongated premaxillaries, short nasals, and the usually large
  maxillaries. The orbits are rather small, bordered behind by the postfrontals and postorbitals,
  which two bones fuse together in the Plesiosauri. The temporal bridge is long, and is formed by
  the junction of the two bones just mentioned with the squamosal mass, which overlaps the greater
  portion of the quadrate, and perhaps contains the quadrato-jugal. The dorsal branch of the
  squamosal joins a corresponding diverging branch of the parietal, and completely shuts off the
  posterior region of the supratemporal foramen. The interparietal hole is small and placed far
  back. The palate possesses a row of teeth on the pterygoids in <i>Lariosaurus</i>. The choanae
  open separately between the vomers and maxillaries. The pterygoids are very long; posteriorly they
  join the quadrates, anteriorly they extend <span class="pagenum" id="page474"><span
  class="smaller">{474}</span></span>right up to the vomers, separating the palatines from each
  other thereby. Palatal vacuities are absent in <i>Nothosaurus</i>; small and oval, between the
  palatines, pterygoids, ectopterygoids and maxillaries in <i>Lariosaurus</i>; still smaller in the
  Plesiosauri.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are mostly biconcave, in the Triassic genera still perforated by the chorda,
  while in many Plesiosauri the centra are solid, with almost plane articulating surfaces. The
  neural arches are usually firmly sutured, or quite fused with the centra. Intercentra are absent,
  except as chevrons in the tail. Although the cervical and some of the thoracic ribs of the
  Triassic genera have typical capitula and tubercula, they articulate exclusively upon the centra,
  and not upon the neural arches also. The number of cervical vertebrae amounts to nine in
  <i>Mesosaurus</i>; in <i>Lariosaurus</i> it is increased to about twenty; and in some Plesiosauri
  to between thirty and forty. The cervical ribs are very short, but they increase gradually towards
  the thorax, which is well protected by long and strong ribs, which decrease again very gradually,
  being still long in the lumbar region. There is, properly speaking, no sacrum, because the one to
  four sacral ribs remain quite separate. The tail is still long in <i>Lariosaurus</i>, consisting
  of about forty much shortened vertebrae; considerably shorter than the neck in most of the
  Plesiosauri. A sternum is absent, but the belly is protected by many strong abdominal ribs,
  crowded together, and consisting each of a median and two pairs of lateral pieces.</p>

  <p>The shoulder-girdle is very strong, composed of scapulae, very strong coracoids, clavicles, and
  an interclavicle. The precoracoids are indicated by a process and a notch in the Triassic genera;
  in the later forms they are abolished. The coracoids always meet in the median line, and often
  produce a strong symphysis. The scapulae possess a very prominent and large acromial process, upon
  which rest the dorsal or lateral ends of the clavicles. In some Plesiosauri the shoulder-girdle
  has undergone an absolutely unique modification. The correct interpretation has been given by C.
  W. Andrews after the examination of exquisitely preserved specimens of <i>Cryptoclidus</i> from
  the Oxford clay of the Middle Oolite, near Peterborough. The dorsal portion or main shaft of the

  the dorsal surface of the scapular symphysis, and the interclavicle seems to be suppressed. Young

  <p>This unique arrangement is correlated with the enormous development of the fore-limbs, although
  nothing of the kind has taken place in the Ichthyosauri, which have similar large paddles. The
  limbs exhibit considerable differences in the various groups of Plesiosauria, but they are all
  pentadactyle. In the oldest, the Mesosauri and Nothosauri, the limbs are still of the terrestrial
  type, although fitted for swimming; the chief bones are still slender and elongated, and none of
  the five fingers and toes have more than five phalanges, the usual number of which seems to be 2,
  3, 4, 5, 3 for the first to fifth digits respectively. In the Plesiosauri the limbs are
  transformed into long hyperphalangeal paddles, unfit for progression on land, rather like those of
  the Ichthyosauria, with much <span class="pagenum" id="page476"><span
  class="smaller">{476}</span></span>shortened radius and ulna, tibia and fibula; but the phalanges,
  which increase to about ten, are always longer than broad, and there is no indication of an
  increase of the number of fingers, or of additional, lateral, phalanx-like nodules. The pelvis is
  very strong; the broad pubes and ischia meet in the middle line, and they either enclose one wide
  undivided foramen, or the two symphysial portions meet, and there are then two obturator-foramina.
  The pubes are generally much larger, especially broader, than the ischia; and although partaking
  in the formation of the acetabulum, they do not articulate with the ilia, at least not in
  Plesiosauri. The ilia are always small; in Plesiosauri attached to only one or two sacral ribs; to
  three or four in the Triassic genera.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri were combined as "Enaliosauria" by Conybeare. Owen
  recognised their fundamental differences, and separated them as "Ichthyopterygia" and
  "Sauropterygia," according to the structure of the limbs. We now know that the paddles of the
  Ichthyosauri bear but a superficial resemblance to the fins of fishes, and are fundamentally
  referable to the pentadactyle type, as are the paddles of the Plesiosauri, although the latter
  retain more of the typical features of reptilian limbs. It was soon recognised that the Nothosauri
  are allied to the Plesiosauri, but the Mesosauri (until then vaguely grouped with the
  Rhynchocephalia, or linked with Protorosauri as Proganosauria) have only recently<a id="NtA_145"

  <p>The limbs are transformed into hyperphalangeal paddles. The clavicles are small, and are
  overlapped ventrally by the strongly developed acromial processes of the scapulae. The vertebrae
  are slightly biconcave or plane. The neck consists of at least twenty vertebrae; those of the
  thoracic region have long transverse processes; the sacral vertebrae are mostly reduced to two or
  one. Very large, massive animals.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pliosauridae</b>.&ndash;About twenty cervical vertebrae, with proximally bifurcated

  of gigantic size; for instance, <i>P. grandis</i>, of the Kimmeridge clay, Upper Oolite, of
  England, has a skull <span class="pagenum" id="page478"><span
  class="smaller">{478}</span></span>nearly 5 feet long and 2 feet broad, armed with many enormous
  conical teeth, some of which reach one foot in length, inclusive of the long collar and
  root-portion. The neck is rather short, owing to the much condensed, disc-shaped centra of the
  vertebrae. Total length of this species about 30 feet. Other species in England and continental
  Europe as far as Russia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Plesiosauridae</b>.&ndash;The neck is very long, and consists of from twenty-eight
  to forty vertebrae. The scapulae do not meet ventrally, but the symphysial portion of the
  coracoids meets the clavicles and the interclavicle, the pectoral arch thus enclosing two
  foramina. Chief genus <i>Plesiosaurus</i>, with many species. The head is comparatively small, the
  neck very long, the tail short, although consisting of from thirty to forty vertebrae. The third
  digit (Fig. 113, C) is the longest, and possesses nine or ten phalanges. The abdominal ribs are
  very strong, and reach from the pectoral to the pelvic girdle. Range from the Lower Trias to the
  Lower Oolite, chiefly European. <i>P. dolichodirus</i> and <i>P. conybeari</i>, the latter
  reaching a total length of more than 15 feet, from the Lower Lias, especially at Lyme Regis.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The skull is long, owing to the elongated slender snout, which <span class="pagenum"
  id="page479"><span class="smaller">{479}</span></span>is formed mainly by the premaxillary bones.
  The nostrils lie far back, in front of the orbits, and are bordered by the long nasals, the
  premaxillaries, a small part of the maxillaries, and posteriorly by the large lacrymal bones. The
  eyes are large, and are strengthened by a sclerotic ring composed of many closely overlapping
  bones. The orbits are very large, and are directed sideways so as to be scarcely visible from
  above. They are formed above by the long prefrontals, which join the postfrontals; behind by the
  long postorbitals; below by the long and slender jugals; in front by the lacrymals and
  prefrontals. The postorbito-temporal region of the skull is short but high, and, with the
  exception of the supratemporal foramen, is entirely closed in by bones, namely, the
  quadrato-jugals, supratemporals, and squamosals. The latter, with the parietals and large
  postfrontals, surround the supratemporal foramina. The parietals and the small frontals enclose
  the parietal foramen. The whole temporal arch consequently recalls much that of the Pareiasauri
  and Stegocephali, chiefly owing to the presence of conspicuous supratemporal and postorbital
  bones, which, together with the quadrato-jugal, close in the whole side without any indication of
  a lateral or infratemporal foramen. The postorbital completely separates the jugal from the
  quadrato-jugal, and this almost hides the quadrate. The occipital condyle is single. The lateral
  occipitals and the supra-occipital bones retain their sutures. The pro-otic and opisthotic bones
  remain separate. The latter lie between the basi- and lateral occipitals, the squamosal, quadrate,
  and pterygoid. The pterygoids, which posteriorly touch the quadrato-jugals, basi-occipitals,
  opisthotics, and basisphenoid, are very long and remain widely separated from each other; in the
  space between them appears the long ensiform presphenoid. Anteriorly they are connected through
  the ectopterygoids with the maxillae, and touch the palatines. These are likewise narrow and
  slender, but touch each other in the middle line, and contain the well-separated, slit-like
  choanae, laterally to which lie the elongated, rather narrow, palatal vacuities. The vomers are
  mostly not visible; when they appear on the surface they are long and narrow, and enclose the
  choanae between them and the palatines.</p>

  <p>The teeth are pointed, conical and thickly covered with enamel, which in transverse sections
  forms vertical ridges, recalling <span class="pagenum" id="page480"><span
  class="smaller">{480}</span></span>the folds of the Labyrinthodonts. The teeth have open roots,
  and are not implanted in separate alveoli, but lie in long grooves of the premaxillaries,
  maxillaries, and dentals.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are numerous, up to 150, two-thirds of which belong to the tail. The centra are
  deeply biconcave and short, not co-ossified with the neural arches, which have therefore often
  broken loose. The atlas much resembles the other cervical vertebrae in so far as its centrum is
  concave in front and scarcely ankylosed with that of the second. Its basiventrals, equivalent to
  the ventral half of the atlas-ring of other reptiles, thus become an unpaired intercentral wedge,
  between the first centrum and the basis of the cranium; the neural arches rest upon the centrum,
  but remain separate from each other, or at least diverge dorsally. The atlas carries no ribs.
  Intercentra occur also between the second and third vertebrae; they reappear in the tail as
  chevron-bones. All the other vertebrae carry ribs, which gradually increase in length towards the
  trunk and decrease again equally gradually on the tail. In the neck and trunk they have separate
  capitula and tubercula, which articulate upon short knobs of the centra; towards the tail these
  shift farther and farther towards the ventral side, and ultimately unite. Although the ribs of the
  trunk are so long, there is no trace of a sternum, but there are many "abdominal ribs" crowded
  together, each consisting of a middle and a pair of lateral pieces.</p>

  <p>The shoulder-girdle is very complete, but the pieces remain separate, or at least do not
  co-ossify; it consists of a <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle, clavicles, broad
  coracoids touching each other in the middle line, and short scapulae. The existence of small
  separate precoracoids is doubtful. The pelvis is much reduced; the small ilium is quite
  unconnected with any vertebrae; the small pubes and ischia form no symphyses. The fore- and
  hind-limbs are very similar to each other; the posterior are, however, much smaller. Both are
  transformed into highly specialised paddles. It is of the greatest importance, as an indication
  that the Ichthyosauri are descendants of a terrestrial stock, and have been modified into what
  they are owing to having taken to marine life, that in the oldest members known, the paddle-like
  structure of the limbs was less advanced than in the later species. In <i>Mixosaurus</i> of the
  Muschelkalk of Europe the ulna and radius are still distinctly longer than broad, and they enclose
  a space <span class="pagenum" id="page481"><span class="smaller">{481}</span></span>between them.
  They articulate with three carpal bones, the ulnare, intermedium, and radiale, while a small
  pisiform bone lies on the outer side, between the ulnare and the outer distal carpal bone. In
  <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>, from the Liassic period onwards, the ulna and radius are much shortened,
  broader than long, and touch each other without any intervening space; the pisiform element is
  enlarged. Lastly, in <i>Ophthalmosaurus</i> of the Middle Oolite (but not in contemporary species
  of <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>) the ulna and radius are still more reduced, and the pisiform has moved up
  to the humerus, so that the latter articulates with three bones.</p>

  <p>Other important features of these paddles are not only the much-increased number of phalanges
  (sometimes up to twenty or more), but also the increase of digits to six or more, produced
  apparently by a splitting of the third finger into two series, and by the development of
  additional rows of phalanx-like bones on the outer and inner margins of the paddle. This increase
  of fingers exists, for instance, in <i>Ichthyosaurus communis</i>, but not in <i>I.
  tenuirostris</i>. Owing to this peculiar development of paddles the constituent bones are
  extremely numerous, and from the radius and ulna downwards they are all closely packed, and have
  assumed a polygonal, often hexagonal, shape, dwindling to more or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page482"><span class="smaller">{482}</span></span>less flattened nodules towards the ends of
  the digits. These carpal and phalangeal bones are common objects in amateurs' collections; they
  fit together by the short angular facets, while the two flat and broader surfaces are those of the
  dorsal and ventral sides.</p>

  <p>The Ichthyosaurs lived upon fishes and cuttlefish, as is indicated by their dentition and the
  shape of the snout, and proved by the coprolites, most of which are full of fragments of bones and
  ganoid scales of fishes, and of the beaks and shells of cuttlefish; the larger of these true
  coprolites (literally "petrified dung"), in coprolite-beds, contain also an abundance of other
  fossils, such as Ammonites, Terebratulae, molluscs and fish-remains; they are several inches long,
  and many of them show on the outside ring-like impressions, undoubtedly caused by a spiral valve
  of the intestinal canal. In conformity with their absolutely aquatic life the Ichthyosaurs were
  viviparous. Several well-preserved adult specimens have been found, which contain the skeletons of
  one or more rather large young within the body, in exactly the position in which such foetal
  creatures would lie, namely, with the head in the pelvic region of the mother, while the rest of
  the body stretches along the vertebral column towards the chest. The suggestion that these young
  Ichthyosaurs have been swallowed by their cannibal elders is too idle to require serious
  refutation.</p>

  <p>Until within a few years Ichthyosaurs were always restored with a smooth and even back, but
  several well-preserved specimens have come to light in W&uuml;rtemberg which show the complete contour
  of the animals, with a long, somewhat jagged fin on the middle of the back. Since then not a few
  specimens in various collections have on closer examination revealed the same feature, except, of
  course, those in which the outlines of the fin had been chiselled away in order to "improve" the
  look of the slab. The fins were undoubtedly of the "adipose" kind;&ndash;raised folds of the skin.
  The latter is now known to have been covered, at least at the bases of the dorsal fins, with hard
  little scales, probably osteoderms.</p>

  <p>Many specimens are beautifully preserved, others present a very peculiar appearance. They look,
  namely, like long rolls of clay, and nobody but an expert would suspect an <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>
  within such a log. The explanation is simple. The dead <span class="pagenum" id="page483"><span
  class="smaller">{483}</span></span>creature was rolled about by the waves of the surf on the
  Liassic muddy beach until it was wrapped in a mantle of clay and then imbedded on the shore.</p>

  <p>The distribution of Ichthyosaurs in time and space is wide. The earliest are found in the
  Middle Trias; in the Lias they are very common, fairly frequent in the Oolites, dying out with the
  Cretaceous epoch. They have left no descendants, being far too specialised, and their origin is
  quite unknown. <i>Mixosaurus</i>, the oldest genus, occurred in Europe, and has also been found in
  the Triassic strata of Spitsbergen. <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>, the chief genus, is known from the
  Liassic, Oolite, and Cretaceous strata of Europe, a famous place being Lyme Regis; and also from
  the Cretaceous strata of Queensland and New Zealand.  The Jurassic of Wyoming has yielded
  <i>Baptanodon</i>.</p>

  <p>The skull bears a superficial resemblance to that of Birds. It articulates with the neck by a
  single condyle, at nearly a right angle. The interparietal foramen is absent, but there are five
  pairs of foramina on the surface of the skull, namely, the nostrils, orbits, supra- and
  infra-temporal and pre-orbital foramina. Most of the constituent bones of the cranium fuse with
  each other, and the composition of the various arches is therefore difficult to make out with
  certainty. The premaxillaries are fused together, and extend dorsally backwards between the
  nasals, which themselves diverge towards the prefrontals. The nostrils are bordered chiefly by the
  maxillaries, nasals, and prefrontals. The orbits are very large, mostly shut off in front from the
  pre-orbital foramina by a bridge, which is formed by descending processes of the prefrontals and
  ascending processes of the jugal. Above and behind, the orbits are bordered by the frontals,
  postfrontals, and possibly the quadrato-jugals. The whole temporal region is shortened from before
  backwards, but heightened dorso-ventrally, and the whole temporal fossa is divided into a supra-
  and infra-temporal portion by the junction of the postfrontal with the squamosal, the latter
  joining the parietal, thus closing the supratemporal fossa behind. This is conspicuous only in the
  older forms, e.g. <i>Dimorphodon</i>, but is very small in <i>Pterodactylus</i>, and quite
  abolished in <i>Pteranodon</i>. The infratemporal fossa is a narrow slit, slanting obliquely
  upwards and backwards, between the quadrate and the quadrato-jugal. A foramen of this kind occurs
  elsewhere only in the Rhynchocephalia. The quadrate is long, firmly fixed, and slants so far
  forwards that the mandibular joint lies on a level below the middle of the orbit. The pterygoids
  articulate with strong and long processes of the basisphenoid, touch the quadrate posteriorly,
  enclose an interpterygoid vacuity, <span class="pagenum" id="page485"><span
  class="smaller">{485}</span></span>and extend forwards as slender bones to the vomer, separating
  the palatines. The choanae are enclosed by the vomer, palatines, and maxillaries, and they lie in
  dorsal recesses above the level of the roof of the mouth. The teeth are alveolar, pointed, of
  variable size, and restricted to the jaws; in the Pteranodonts they are absent.</p>

  <p>The brain is known from the natural cast of <i>Scaphognathus</i>, and shows some remarkably
  bird-like features, especially the width of the hemispheres, which touch the well-developed
  cerebellum, while the optic lobes lie on the sides of the cerebellum, with a pair of appendices,
  the so-called flocculi, elsewhere known in birds only.</p>

  <p>The caudal vertebrae are still amphicoelous, while the presacral vertebrae are procoelous.
  Abdominal ribs are few in number and are very thin. The true ribs possess capitula and tubercula;
  those of the neck are very short and directed backwards; in the thoracic region they are long, and
  some are attached to a broad sternum with a keel and a median anterior process, on the sides of
  which latter articulate the coracoids. Precoracoids and clavicles are absent. The scapulae are
  long, sabre-shaped, and turned back as in birds; in <i>Pteranodon</i> they show the unique
  modification of articulating with special processes of the neural arches of several ankylosed
  thoracic vertebrae.</p>

  <p>The hand possesses only four fingers; the four phalanges of the ulnar finger are very much
  elongated for the support of the patagium; the other fingers remain short and are provided with
  little claws. The ilia are expanded horizontally, and are firmly attached to from three to six
  vertebrae, which mostly fuse together into a sacrum. The ventral half of the pelvis consists of a
  pair of broad bones, which contain a small obturator-foramen; they form a ventral symphysis, and
  are usually fused with the ilium. These bones represent the conjoint ischia and pubes, while the
  so-called pubes, a pair of flat and club-shaped bones, are excluded <span class="pagenum"
  id="page486"><span class="smaller">{486}</span></span>from the acetabulum. The whole arrangement
  resembles that of the Crocodilian pelvis. The hind-limbs are bird-like in so far as the fibulae
  are reduced to splints, and attached to the proximal halves of the long and slender tibiae. The
  feet contain five separate toes with rather long metatarsals and short claws. Many of the bones
  are hollow.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Pterosauria have no relationship with the birds, in spite of the number of
  apparently striking resemblances (<i>e.g.</i> choanae, pre-orbital foramina, brain, scapula,
  fibula, cervical vertebrae), which are, however, coincidences, cases of convergence, in conformity
  with the aerial life. The totally different plan of the wings is sufficient to show this. On the
  other hand, the real affinities of this group of flying reptiles are unknown. They turn up "fully
  fledged" in the Lower Lias, and they reach their highest specialisation in the Upper Cretaceous
  epoch, with which they have died out. In fact we do not know any forms through which to connect
  them with other extinct reptiles. The skull shows some Rhynchocephalian features; the pelvis,
  Crocodilian features; and this combination points back a long way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order PTEROSAURI.</b></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Pterodactyli</b>, with alveolar teeth in the upper and lower jaws. Imperfect
  remains, impressions of phalanges of the long patagial finger, are known from the Rhaetic of
  W&uuml;rtemberg. The oldest well-known genus is <i>Dimorphodon</i>, Lower Lias of Lyme Regis. <i>D.
  macronyx.</i>&ndash;Total length between 3 and 4 feet, of which the large light skull takes up
  about 9 inches, and the long thin tail about 2 feet. The patagial finger is about 20 inches, the
  whole wing about 28 inches long. <i>Rhamphorhynchus longicaudatus</i> of the Upper Oolite of
  Germany is remarkable for the long slender teeth, which are directed forwards and separated by
  wide spaces from each other. The nine or ten cervical vertebrae are elongated. <i>R. phyllurus</i>
  of the same geological age has left impressions of the flying membranes. They extend from the
  whole length of the wing and the sides of the trunk to the thigh as far as the knee, and from the
  inside of the hind-limbs to the tail. The end of the tail carries a spatulate membrane. Allied is
  <i>Ornithocheirus</i>, with many species in the English Wealden and Greensand. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page487"><span class="smaller">{487}</span></span><i>Pterodactylus</i>, with
  many species from the Upper Oolite, chiefly of Germany.&ndash;The tail is very short, consisting
  of a few vertebrae only. The seven neck-vertebrae are so much elongated that the neck is as long
  as the trunk with the tail. <i>P. longirostris</i> measures about 1 foot in total length, while
  <i>P. spectabilis</i> is one of the smallest, only of the size of a lark. The wings, however,
  measure 10 inches from tip to tip. The largest is <i>P. giganteus</i>, with a "spread" of more
  than 5 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Pteranodontes.</b>&ndash;The beak is long, pointed, toothless, and laterally
  compressed; mandibular symphysis very long. <i>Pteranodon longiceps.</i>&ndash;The skull has a
  long parieto-supraoccipital crest, which extends far back. The supratemporal foramina are
  abolished. The pre-orbital and orbital foramina are confluent. The scapulae are attached to
  several thoracic vertebrae. The skull of this gigantic species has a length of two feet and a
  half, and the spread of the wings measures nearly 20 feet. This, and several much smaller species,
  are from the Middle Cretaceous formation of Kansas.</p>

    quadrates, single lateral temporal arches and procoelous vertebrae; with paddle-shaped,
    pentadactyle limbs; and with the teeth ankylosed to the jaws.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The skull possesses many of the essential features of the typical lizards. The premaxillaries,
  frontals, and parietals are fused into unpaired bones. There is an interparietal foramen. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page488"><span class="smaller">{488}</span></span>The nostrils are dorsal,
  bordered by the premaxillae, nasals, prefrontals, and maxillaries. The quadrato-jugal arch is
  incomplete, and the orbit is posteriorly confluent with the infratemporal fossa, but a
  supratemporal space is shut off by the single arch, which is composed of the postfrontal,
  squamosal, and supratemporal. The latter is interposed between, and connects the squamosal and
  quadrate with the latero-posterior branch of the parietal. There is a space between this
  parieto-squamosal arcade and the epi-otic, which is fused with the lateral wing of the lateral
  occipital bone. The foramen magnum is bordered by the two supra-occipital, lateral occipital, and
  the unpaired basioccipital bones; the condyle is triple. The quadrate is movable, articulating
  with the squamosal and laterally expanded epi-otic. There is no bony connexion of the quadrate
  with the jugal, which is restricted to its anterior half, and attached to the maxillary and
  lacrymal. The quadrato-jugal is absent as a separate bone; it is probably fused with the anterior
  surface of the quadrate, as indicated by a perforation of the quadrate, resembling in this respect
  the Rhynchocephalia. The vomers are long, and separate the elongated choanae from each other. The
  palatines separate the vomers from the pterygoids, which enclose a long median vacuity and are not
  connected with the quadrates. The teeth are conical, and stand near the inner margin of the jaws
  upon little prominences, with which they fuse. Some genera have teeth upon the pterygoids
  also.</p>

  <p>The vertebrae are very numerous and are mostly procoelous. They are noteworthy for the
  possession of an additional anterior and a posterior pair of articulating processes on the neural
  arches, homologous with the zygosphenes and zygantra of Snakes and Iguanidae (see <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page582">582</a></span>). Intercentra are absent, except in the tail. The
  ribs have no tubercula, and articulate with the centra of the vertebrae to which they belong.</p>

  <p>The pectoral arch is strong. The scapulae are short and broad; the coracoids, fused with the
  precoracoids, except for a notch, are flat and broad, and meet ventrally; posteriorly they
  articulate upon the anterior margin of the flat sternum, to the lateral margin of which are
  attached several ribs. Clavicles and interclavicle seem to be absent. Abdominal ribs are likewise
  absent. The pelvic girdle is feeble; the ilia, ischia, and pubes are loosely connected with each
  other, the pairs of ventral elements <span class="pagenum" id="page489"><span
  class="smaller">{489}</span></span>meeting also in the middle line. The ilia are loosely attached
  to two vertebrae in the Dolichosauri; in the Mosasauri they have lost this connexion. Both
  anterior and posterior limbs are transformed into pentadactyle paddles, with much shortened and
  broadened bones of the arms and legs. The digits are to a certain extent hyperphalangeal, since
  several of them possess five phalanges.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Pythonomorpha are undoubtedly allied to the Sauria, but they are certainly not
  their ancestors, since typical Autosauri occur in the Lower Chalk; nor are the Snakes their
  descendants, in spite of many convergent resemblances. We consider them to be the marine
  collateral branch of the Sauria, which rapidly developed highly specialised, often very large
  forms, restricted to the Cretaceous epoch, with a wide, cosmopolitan distribution.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. DOLICHOSAURI.</b></p>

  <i>Dolichosaurus longicollis</i> of the Lower Chalk of Kent and Sussex; total length about 3 feet,
  with about seventeen cervical vertebrae and pleurodont teeth. <i>Acteosaurus</i> of Istria;
  anterior extremities distinctly shorter than the posterior pair; tail long. Vertebrae, like those
  of <i>Dolichosaurus</i>, with zygosphenes. <i>Plioplatecarpus</i> of the Upper Chalk of Holland
  has a slender interclavicle; the vertebrae are without zygosphenes, but those of the cervical
  region possess a downwardly directed long hypapophysial process with a separately ossified
  epiphysis.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. MOSASAURI.</b></p>

  <p>The two halves of the lower jaw are connected by ligament and are therefore movable as in
  Snakes. There are no sacral vertebrae, the pelvis having lost its connexion with the vertebral
  column. The formation of the limbs into paddles is more pronounced than in the Dolichosauri.</p>

  <p><i>Mosasaurus</i>, the chief genus, so called from Mosa, the Latin name of the river Maas, with

  <p class="sp3">The Sauria, which comprise the <span class="sc">Autosauri</span> or Lacertilia in
  the wider sense and the <span class="sc">Ophidia</span> or Snakes, are the most recently developed
  groups of Reptiles. No fossils are known from strata earlier than those of the Cretaceous epoch.
  Their origin has probably to be looked for among the Prosauria, of which <i>Sphenodon</i>, cf.
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page294">294</a></span>, is the only surviving member. The Sauria
  have attained their great development within the Tertiary period. They, both Autosauri and
  Ophidia, are now the two dominant Reptilian groups, and they have, so to speak, a future before
  them, being apparently still on the increase in numbers and species, but certainly not in
  size.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. AUTOSAURI or LACERTILIA</b>&ndash;<i>LIZARDS</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Saurians which have the right and left halves of the mandibles connected by a
  sutural symphysis.</i></p>

  <p>The overwhelming majority possess well-developed limbs, movable eyelids and cutaneous scales,
  covered by the mostly thin and horny epidermis. But there are many kinds of Autosauri, especially
  those belonging to the degraded, burrowing families, which have lost not only one or both pairs of
  limbs, but even the limb-girdles, while the eyes have become concealed beneath the skin, and in
  some cases the scales have been lost, or reduced <span class="pagenum" id="page492"><span
  class="smaller">{492}</span></span>to mere vestiges. Moreover in some of these burrowing and
  limbless forms the quadrate bones have become more or less immovable.</p>

  <p>We divide the Autosauri into three sub-orders:&ndash;I. <span class="sc">Geckones</span>, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page502">502</a></span>; II. <span class="sc">Lacertae</span>, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page513">513</a></span>; III. <span class="sc">Chamaeleontes</span>,
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page567">567</a></span>, with about 270, 1500, and 50 species
  respectively.</p>

  <p>The Autosauri are of great interest, since they exhibit a great, almost endless variety in
  shape, size, and structure in direct adaptation to their surroundings. Most of these modifications
  are restricted to the external organs, or rather to those which come into direct contact with the
  outer world, namely the skin, the limbs, the tail, or the tongue. The majority of the Autosauri
  are terrestrial, but there are also semi-aquatic forms. There are climbing, swiftly running, and
  even flying forms, while others lead a subterranean life like earthworms. Most of them live on
  animal food, varying from tiny insects and worms to Birds and Mammals, while others live upon
  vegetable diet. According to this diet, the teeth and the whole digestive tract are modified. The
  intestine is relatively short in the carnivorous, long in the herbivorous species. But swiftness,
  the apparatus necessary for climbing, running, and digging, the mechanism of the tongue, the
  armament and the muscles of the jaws (hence modifications of the cranial arches, etc.), stand also
  in correlation with the kind of food and with the way in which it has to be procured.</p>

  <p>A very interesting study of the influence of the climate and the nature of the country upon
  Reptiles has been made by Boettger<a id="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> with
  especial reference to the Transcaspian desert-region. The winter is there short, but very severe,
  and there is a considerable amount of snowfall, while the summer is intolerably hot. The spring
  arrives suddenly. Lilies and tulips, which have been asleep for nine or ten months, sprout towards
  the end of February, and a carpet of flowers covers the ground for a short time. Then everything
  shrivels up during the rainless and fierce heat of the summer, and the autumnal storms of dust and
  sand kill off the last remnants of vegetation. There are no trees, and even prickly shrubs are
  rare. Instead of broad leaves the plants have grass-like blades or needles. The little shrubs do
  not form coherent patches, but they are scattered <span class="pagenum" id="page493"><span
  class="smaller">{493}</span></span>about, and around the roots of each shrub the wind accumulates
  little mounds of sand and dust, a place of retreat for rodents, lizards, snakes, and even for the
  female tortoises. G. Kadde's "law of the steppe" is in full force;&ndash;there is little change of
  forms in a wide district, but all these forms are peculiar, and they congregate socially in great
  numbers. Most characteristic are those kinds of Geckos which, like <i>Teratoscincus</i>, cf. <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page507">507</a></span>, have become inhabitants of sand instead of
  climbers of rocks and trees; various kinds of <i>Phrynocephalus</i>, cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page521">521</a></span>, and <i>Varanus griseus</i>; the four desert-species of Lacertidae
  are brownish-grey or sandy yellow, with conspicuous stripes or spots. Of snakes are to be
  mentioned <i>Eryx jaculus</i>, digging in the sand, and about ten other non-poisonous snakes.
  <i>Tropidonotus</i> is, of course, restricted to permanently watery places, where they can get
  frogs and fishes. Of poisonous snakes there is the Cobra and <i>Echis arenicola</i>. Of Amphibia
  only <i>Bufo viridis</i> and <i>Rana esculenta</i> var. <i>ridibunda</i> exist in suitable places,
  but there are neither Tree-frogs nor Newts.</p>

  <p>Characteristic features of these inhabitants of the desert are the following:&ndash;</p>

  <p>1. Velocity. The Lizards are slender. The Sand-snake, <i>Tephrometopon</i>, is whip-like; even
  the Cobra has a relatively narrower and longer tail than the Indian specimens, although the number
  of the vertebrae and of the scales is the same. All the desert-snakes are remarkable for the great
  number of their ventral shields, two hundred and more.</p>

  <p>2. Hard, scaly covering, for instance in <i>Agama</i>, <i>Echis</i>, <i>Gymnodactylus</i>,
  <i>Teratoscincus</i>; the latter with its fish-like scales is exceptional among Geckos, resembling
  the likewise deserticolous <i>Geckolepis</i> and <i>Homopholis</i> of Africa.</p>

  <p>3. Capacity for digging in the sand in order to escape great cold, or burning heat. All the
  Lizards and the Tortoise, <i>Testudo horsfieldi</i>, have strong claws. The snakes <i>Typhlops</i>
  and <i>Eryx</i> dig with their specially modified snouts, and their tails are very short and
  blunt. The Sand-viper, <i>Echis</i>, has the scales of the back arranged in very oblique rows, so
  that it can heap sand upon its body by wriggling, shaking, and up-and-down motions of the body.
  The Agamoid <i>Phrynocephalus</i> does this by means of lateral folds of the skin.</p>

  <p>4. Arrangements for running on sand. The lizard <i>Eremias</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page494"><span class="smaller">{494}</span></span>has very large crural shields;
  <i>Scapteira</i> has the digits broadened out into shovels; others, e.g. <i>Phrynocephalus</i> and
  <i>Teratoscincus</i>, have long lateral fringes on the digits, a very rare arrangement among
  Geckos, occurring elsewhere among them only in <i>Ptenopus</i> and <i>Stenodactylus</i>, which are
  likewise inhabitants of the desert.</p>

  <p>5. Protection against the everlasting, ubiquitous sand. In the digging species the nostrils are
  directed upwards instead of forwards; in most of the snakes they are protected by complicated
  valves, or they are reduced to small pin-holes. The eyes of <i>Typhlops</i> are overhung by the
  head-shields. In <i>Agama</i> and <i>Phrynocephalus</i> the margins of the lids are broadened into
  plates and are furnished with peculiar scales. In <i>Teratoscincus</i> the upper lid is enlarged.
  The lizard <i>Mabuia</i> has the lower lid much enlarged, with a transparent window in it, so that
  the eye can be closed without impeding sight, an arrangement carried to the extreme in
  <i>Ablepharus</i>, cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page560">560</a></span>. The ear-opening is
  either small, or protected by fringes of scales, or it is abolished, <i>e.g.</i> in
  <i>Phrynocephalus</i>.</p>

  <p>6. Coloration. Pure green is quite absent, even in <i>Bufo viridis</i> and in <i>Rana
  esculenta</i>, since there is no green in that country, at least not of long duration. White, with
  grey and black spots, occurs only in the nocturnal Geckos.  Yellow, brownish, reddish colours are
  common, in adaptation to the sand. The advantages of the carmine-red, and of the blue spots of
  <i>Phrynocephalus</i>, and the yellow or bright red under surface of its tail, are unknown.
  Striation is of frequent occurrence among the lizards and snakes, probably in adaptation to the
  dry grass heaped up around the scattered shrubs.</p>

  <p>Concerning the various organic systems of the Autosauri only some of the more important
  features may here be mentioned.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton.</b>&ndash;The vertebrae are procoelous, with the exception of most of the
  Geckones, in which they are amphicoelous. So-called intercentra, in the shape of unpaired nodules
  or wedges, persist between most of the cervical vertebrae. In the tail these wedges, the remnants
  of the basiventralia, are generally present, frequently in the shape of chevron-bones. Sometimes
  they fuse with the centra of the vertebrae; occasionally the axial or central portion of these
  basiventrals persists as a sort of fibrous disc, which may calcify separately, and is interposed
  between the caudal end of the centrum and the articulating <span class="pagenum"
  id="page495"><span class="smaller">{495}</span></span>knob. The caudal vertebrae of the Geckones
  and of most Lacertae are liable to break across, like those of <i>Sphenodon</i>. They are enabled
  to do this owing to a transverse split, which makes its appearance with the ossification of the
  vertebral bodies and extends later into and across the neural arch and the various lateral
  processes. The split is ultimately referable to a transverse septum of cartilage, wrongly called
  chordal cartilage, which develops in the shell of the body of the vertebra, destroys the chorda,
  and extends peripherally. The cells of this septum retain throughout life their juvenile
  quasi-embryonic character. When the tail is broken off&ndash;and this always happens at such a
  septum&ndash;the cells of the remaining half reproduce a new tail. The latter is, however, in
  reality a sham tail, since neither new centra nor arches, but only a non-segmented rod or tube of
  fibro-cartilage is produced by this process of regeneration. Reproduction of centra is precluded
  by the previous normal reduction of the chorda, around which alone proper bony centra could be
  formed. The regenerated tail is, however, invested with new muscles, and with skin, but the scales
  often differ considerably from those of the normal organ. Boulenger<a id="NtA_148"
  href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> has found that the new or aberrant scaling is in some cases a
  reversion to an ancestral form. This is, for instance, the case in <i>Pseudopus</i>, and in the
  Tejoid genus <i>Gymnophthalmus</i>; to a certain extent also in Geckos and Skinks. On the other
  hand, Lacertidae, Gerrhosauridae, and also Anguidae reproduce a caudal scaling true to their type.
  Injured or broken-off tails are often reproduced double, or even trifid; sometimes an additional
  little tail grows out from an injured spot, anywhere on the side of the old remaining but mended
  tail.</p>

  <p>The ribs of the trunk articulate by their capitula only, while the reduced tubercula are
  attached to their vertebrae by ligaments. In the tail the capitular portion is much reduced, while
  the tuberculum is much stronger and lies behind, no longer above, the capitulum, fusing sometimes
  directly with the centrum. The ribs of the poststernal region of Geckos and Chameleons are very
  long, and meet each other in the middle line, forming thin cartilaginous hoops.</p>

  <p>The limbs are of the typical pentadactyloid type. The distal tarsalia are often fused with the
  metatarsals, so that the chief <span class="pagenum" id="page496"><span
  class="smaller">{496}</span></span>bending of the foot is effected by truly intertarsal joints.
  The greatest modification occurs in the foot of the Chameleons, in which the proximal tarsalia are
  reduced in number, and form a globe for the articulation with the tibia and fibula.</p>

  <p>The shoulder-girdle and sternum much resemble that of <i>Sphenodon</i> in their completeness.
  The coracoids articulate with the sternum; the precoracoids and the basal parts of the scapulae
  often send out several processes towards those of the other side, so that several fenestrae are
  formed. The clavicles are complete, but are absent in the Chameleons. The interclavicle is mostly
  <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped. A presternum is absent, but the sternum proper is well
  developed, often forming a rhomboid plate, usually cartilaginous, often diverging backwards into
  xiphisternal processes.</p>

  <p>The pelvis is attached to two vertebrae by means of several ribs. The ischium and pubis form
  symphyses. The pubis carries a well-developed lateral process, and the obturator-nerve pierces the
  shaft of the pubis. Epipubic and hypo-ischial cartilages are of frequent occurrence.</p>

  <p>The hyoid apparatus consists of a median, styliform rod, which extends forwards into the
  tongue; it is often bifid behind. The unpaired piece carries two pairs of horns. The posterior of
  these, the first pair of branchial arches, extends backwards along the gullet, and is very long if
  the tongue is very slender and protractile. The anterior pair, the hyoid arches, consists of two
  pieces on either side, one short and directed forwards, the other long, connected with the former
  at a sharp angle and continued upwards to the sides of the skull, often in direct continuity with
  the columellar chain of the ear.</p>

  <p>The modifications of the skull concern chiefly the composition of the temporal arches, see
  Figs. 55, M, N, O, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page281">281</a></span>. The quadrate bone is
  movable, but it has become fixed in various degraded families, where the skull shows a great
  reduction and concentration; the postorbital and temporal arches, the interorbital septum, and
  with it the columellae cranii are lost. The columella cranii of the Chameleons, which is generally
  stated to be absent, is really present, although in a much reduced state, and is partly imbedded
  in the interorbital septum. The occipital condyle has become bifid in Amphisbaenidae.</p>

  <p>Burrowing and living in sand are often correlated with partial or complete reduction or loss of
  the limbs and their <span class="pagenum" id="page497"><span
  class="smaller">{497}</span></span>girdles. This loss of limbs is as a rule correlated with an
  elongation of the trunk, not always at the expense of the tail, which in such cases is much
  shortened. The vestiges of the hind-limbs come to lie as near the vent as possible. This reduction
  of the limbs occurred in several families which are not directly related to each other. Moreover,
  it does not occur in all the members of the family, not always in those of the same genus, and
  there is a considerable amount of individual variation. In most cases of reduction the fore-limbs
  disappear before, or are smaller than, the hind-limbs. In the Amphisbaenidae (cf. <i>Chirotes</i>,
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page566">566</a></span>), and in the Tejidae the reverse takes
  place. In extreme cases the reduction is so complete that even the pectoral girdle has
  disappeared, leaving scarcely any trace, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Dibamus</i>, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page564">564</a></span>.</p>

  <p>The <b>skin</b> is normally covered with scales, which are formed by the cutis and have a horny
  epidermal coating. The latter, thin and transparent, is shed periodically, peeling off in flakes,
  except in <i>Anguis</i> and perhaps other snake-shaped creatures, which shed the skin in one
  piece. In the Amphisbaenidae the scales have practically disappeared. When well developed the
  scales are prominent, and imbricate or overlap with their free posterior edges; but in many cases
  the scales are not "scale-like" at all, only like little tubercles, which give the skin a granular
  appearance. Frequently, for instance in the Scincidae and Anguidae, all the scales contain
  "osteoderms," or ossified portions of the cutis, and encase the whole body and tail. In other
  families, <i>e.g.</i> Lacertidae, such osteoderms are restricted to the scales or shields on the
  head, where they come into contact and fuse with the underlying cranial bones, and moreover roof
  in the supratemporal fossa.</p>

  <p>The skin of the Autosauri is entirely devoid of glands. The femoral and pre-anal pores of many
  families, occurring especially in the males, are probably not glands. They are arranged in rows on
  the under surface of the thighs and in front of the anal opening. Each of these organs perforates
  a scale and leads into a tubular invagination, which is lined with epidermal cells, the
  proliferation of which produces a horny yellowish d&eacute;bris, and this fills the tube and appears
  above the surface in the shape of a little cone. The use of this "excretion" is unknown; it is
  possibly hedonic.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page498"><span class="smaller">{498}</span></span></div>

  <p>Most Autosauri are capable of changing colour. In most of them this faculty is restricted to
  the assumption of paler or darker tints owing to the shifting of the colouring matter contained in
  the chromatophores. In others new, often vivid colours are the result. The mechanism is described
  in detail in the Chameleon on pp. <a href="#page570">570</a> and <a href="#page574">574</a>.</p>

  <p>Pigment is deposited either directly in the upper strata of the cutis, just below the
  Malpighian layer, or it is contained in chromatophores. The latter are imbedded in the deeper
  layers of the cutis, and send out movable contractile processes, in which their pigmented
  protoplasm is conveyed towards or away from the surface. The only colours available are black,
  red, yellow, and white, with their combinations of grey and brown. The white pigment consists of
  guanin-salts. Blue and green are structural colours, not due to pigment. The same can no longer be
  said of the Ophidia, since Boulenger has observed accidentally that green Tree-snakes (e.g.
  <i>Dryophis</i>) give the alcohol in which they are kept the colour of green Chartreuse.</p>

  <p><b>Digestive organs.</b>&ndash;The tongue is very variably developed, and affords good
  taxonomic characters. It is always furnished with many tactile, or with gustatory, corpuscles.
  When the tongue is very long and narrow it is generally forked, and in these cases, for instance
  in the Varanidae, is almost entirely used as a sensory organ. In others, especially where it is
  broad, it assists in catching the food, and in the Chameleons it has attained a most elaborate
  development (see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page569">569</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Salivary glands are restricted to labial glands. In <i>Heloderma</i> those of the lower jaw are
  transformed into poison-glands, an analogy to what prevails in the poisonous snakes. The
  intestinal canal is longest in the herbivorous forms; the rectum sometimes possesses a short blind
  sac or caecum.</p>

  <p>The <b>cloaca</b> of the Sauria is somewhat modified; instead of the Coprodaeum, Urodaeum, and
  Proctodaeum forming three successive chambers, the urodaeum is practically reduced to its dorsal
  half, forming a dorsal recess between the two other chambers. The Coprodaeum is constricted into
  several successive chambers, and is always well shut off from the urodaeum by a strong sphincter.
  The urodaeum receives the urinary excretions, which are mostly chalky white and are rather
  consistent instead of being fluid. The right and left oviducts also open into it. The vasa <span
  class="pagenum" id="page499"><span class="smaller">{499}</span></span>deferentia open into the
  dorso-lateral portions of the walls of the urodaeum, but the sperma is conducted by folds of the
  lining of this chamber towards the bases of the copulatory organs, which, although arising from
  the lateral and posterior corners of the cloaca, where uro- and procto-daeum meet, are stowed away
  outside the cloaca. These organs are always paired. The proctodaeum or outermost cloacal chamber
  is shallow. Its inner opening is round and is furnished with a sphincter, but it is surrounded and
  covered by lips of the outer skin, which form a transverse slit. This is due to the peculiar
  arrangement of the copulatory organs.</p>

  <p>Each organ consists of a tube of erectile tissue, and can be everted like the finger of a
  glove. To the apex of the tube is attached a long retractor muscle, which arises from the
  ventro-lateral surfaces of the caudal vertebrae and extends a considerable distance back. When at
  rest and withdrawn the organs form slight conical, longitudinal swellings on either side of the
  root of the tail, an external feature by which male specimens can generally be distinguished. Only
  one organ is inserted at one time.</p>

  <p>The majority of Autosauri lay <b>eggs</b>, surrounded by a white or yellowish shell, which is
  either hard, for instance in Geckos, or parchment-like, <i>e.g.</i> in Chameleons, in <i>Lacerta
  viridis</i> and <i>L. agilis</i>, and in <i>L. vivipara</i>. Eggs with a thin and soft shell
  sometimes exhibit the paradoxical feature of increasing in size after they have been laid. This is
  explained by the growth of the embryo, which stretches the shell and does not merely live upon the
  white and yellow contents of the egg itself, but also takes in air and moisture. Many Lizards do
  not lay their eggs until they contain ripe embryos, which burst the shell shortly after
  deposition. Some, for instance <i>Lacerta vivipara</i>, <i>Anguis fragilis</i>, and <i>Chamaeleo
  pumilus</i>, are practically viviparous. The embryos, especially those which are enclosed in
  hard-shelled eggs, are provided with a sharp, calcareous "egg-tooth" on the top of the snout.</p>

  <p>The <b>lungs</b> are thin-walled sacs, sometimes provided with lateral ex-sacculations, and
  these reach their greatest development in the Chameleons. The breathing is effected by the motion
  of the ribs. Inflatable sacs on the throat, or on the sides of the neck, for ornamental or sexual
  purposes, occur in various families. The lungs of much-elongated, snake-shaped Lizards are
  generally <span class="pagenum" id="page500"><span
  class="smaller">{500}</span></span>asymmetrical; the right being reduced in Amphisbaenidae; the
  left in other cases.</p>

  <p>Several Autosauri, for instance the Geckos, <i>Psammodromus</i>, and various other Lacertidae
  have a weak voice.</p>

  <p>The <b>Fat-bodies</b> are mysterious organs which are situated beneath the skin, and extend
  from the inguinal region forwards along the ventral sides of the belly. They are often of
  considerable dimensions; largest in the spring, in both sexes, at the time of propagation. Their
  colour is greyish-white or yellow, owing to the great accumulation of fat in the meshes of the
  connective tissue which composes the frame-work of these organs. An artery enters them, breaks up
  into capillaries, and these combine to form an efferent vein. After the time of propagation these
  organs are reduced to grey or reddish flaps, consisting mainly of very vascular connective tissue.
  G. W. Butler<a id="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> has written a long paper on their
  morphology. The same author<a id="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> has investigated
  the "sub-divisions of the body-cavity in Lizards, Crocodiles, and Birds," with reference to
  peritoneal diaphragmatic structures.</p>

  <p>The <b>geographical distribution of the Autosauri</b> teaches few, but important lessons. We
  have to restrict ourselves to the principal families, leaving out those which are small and have a
  limited distribution; also those which, like the few Anelytropidae in Africa and in Mexico, are
  not natural groups.</p>

  <p>The Geckones, which are probably the oldest of modern Autosauri, are practically cosmopolitan,
  being absent only in the cold and in the cooler temperate regions. They are common even in Oceanic
  Islands, for instance in New Zealand and in the Sandwich Islands. Although not at all aquatic,
  they are particularly fit to be transported accidentally on or in the trunks of floating trees, to
  which they cling firmly, and they can exist without food for months. I once received a little
  South American Gecko in perfect health from a grocer, who found it in a well-closed wooden box
  containing canned meat, two months after delivery of the box in Cambridge.</p>

  <p>The Scincidae, likewise an old family, are equally cosmopolitan, but although many exist in the
  islands of the Pacific a few only occur in New Zealand. Many of the genera have a very wide
  distribution; for instance, <i>Lygosoma</i>, with its one hundred and sixty or more species,
  occurs in the Australian and <span class="pagenum" id="page501"><span
  class="smaller">{501}</span></span>Palaeotropical regions, and also in North and Central America,
  not extending, however, into South America. <i>Mabuia</i>, with more than sixty species, occurs in
  the Palaeotropical and the Neotropical regions. Whether these and other widely-distributed genera
  are all natural is another question.</p>

  <p>The Agamidae, Varanidae, Lacertidae, and the Chamaeleontes are restricted to the Old World. The
  Agamidae and Varanidae have the widest distribution, occurring in the whole of the Old World with
  the notable exception of Madagascar and New Zealand. The Lacertidae are Palaearctic and
  Palaeotropical, being however absent in Madagascar, and, broadly speaking, not extending eastwards
  beyond Wallace's line. It is a most suggestive fact that most of those families of Reptiles, and
  even of other Vertebrates which have a wide distribution and are apparently debarred from
  transgressing Wallace's line, are also absent from Madagascar.</p>

  <p>The Chameleons are essentially African, with their centre of greatest abundance and development
  in Madagascar, only one or two species occurring in Socotra, Southern Arabia, and in Ceylon and
  Southern India. Since they also exist, <i>Ch. sechellensis</i>, on various islands in the Indian
  Ocean, for instance in Mauritius and the Seychelles, the Chameleons are perhaps an indication of
  the former existence of a direct land-connexion between Southern India and Southern Africa.</p>

  <p>The Iguanidae are essentially American, with the remarkable exceptions of <i>Chalarodon</i> and
  <i>Hoplurus</i> in Madagascar, and <i>Brachylophus</i> in the Fiji and Friendly Islands. This
  peculiar distribution finds some analogies in that of Dendrobatinae (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page272">272</a></span>), certain Boinae (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page601">601</a></span>), and <i>Centetes</i> and <i>Solenodon</i> among Insectivora. An
  Iguana (<i>I. europaea</i>) has, however, been described from the Eocene of France and England.
  The supposed relationship of the Iguanidae with the Agamidae makes the problem only more puzzling,
  since Agamidae are absent in Madagascar. If we have recourse to the Zonuridae, which are confined
  to Africa and Madagascar, and are supposed to be intermediate between Anguidae and Iguanidae, then
  we may have ultimately to conclude that the Malagasy Iguanoid genera and the American Iguanidae
  are a case of convergent evolution.</p>

  <p>The Amphisbaenidae are distributed over America, including the West Indies, Africa exclusive of
  Madagascar, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page502"><span
  class="smaller">{502}</span></span>Mediterranean countries. This is very puzzling, considering
  that these subterranean, helpless creatures positively cannot travel. Boulenger regards them "as a
  degraded type of the Tejidae, with which they are to some extent connected by <i>Chalcides</i> and
  its allies," <i>i.e.</i> genera with reduced limbs, cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page562">562</a></span>.</p>

  <p>However, this supposed relationship with a strictly American family does not explain the
  occurrence of Amphisbaenidae in Africa. Either they are not a natural group, or they had, as
  already degraded, limbless creatures, a much wider range; and this would imply their being a very
  old family, perhaps as old as we suppose the Coecilians to be.</p>

  <p>Anguidae occur in North and South America, in Europe and the Mediterranean parts of North
  Africa, and in Trans-Gangetic India. Their older relations, the Zonuridae, inhabit Africa and
  Madagascar.</p>

  <p>Madagascar is consequently devoid of Agamidae, Varanidae, Lacertidae, Anguidae, and
  Amphisbaenidae, while it possesses, besides the cosmopolitan Scincidae and Geckones, only
  Chameleons, Gerrhosauridae, and Zonuridae,&ndash;all three essentially African families,&ndash;and
  a few Iguanidae. This means that the Autosaurian fauna of Madagascar is intimately related to that
  of Africa, and that it possesses only old families so far as Sauria are concerned. But since this
  great island was separated from its continent not earlier than in Mid-Tertiary times, it follows
  that most of these "old" families are comparatively recent.</p>

  <p>Australia possesses only Agamidae and Varanidae besides the ubiquitous Geckos and Skinks.
  Besides the latter two families it has nothing in common either with Madagascar (an analogy with
  the Anura) or with America. The Autosauri consequently do not support the idea of a Notogaea, cf.
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page74">74</a></span>. This again indicates the comparatively
  recent age of Autosaurian families. The marked difference which exists between the Old and the New
  World points to the same conclusion. On the other hand, the Autosauri support the idea that the
  Palaeotropical region is but the tropical and therefore richer continuation of the now
  impoverished Palaearctic sub-region.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 1. Geckones.</b>&ndash;The typical Geckos are characterised as follows.
  <i>Four-footed Autosauri with amphicoelous vertebrae; skull without bony temporal arches;
  clavicles dilated and with a perforation near the ventral end; parietal bones <span
  class="pagenum" id="page503"><span class="smaller">{503}</span></span>separate; eyes (with few
  exceptions) without movable lids; pleurodont; tongue fleshy and broad, slightly nicked anteriorly,
  and capable of protrusion.</i></p>

  <p>This definition does not apply to a few forms. In the <i>Eublepharinae</i> the vertebrae have
  advanced to the procoelous condition, and the parietals are fused together, while the eyes are
  provided with typical, movable lids. In the <i>Uroplatinae</i> the clavicles are not dilated, and
  the nasals are fused into one bone. The Geckos seem to be not only a very independent but also a
  very old branch of Saurians. Although fossil representatives are unknown, the resemblance of their
  vertebrae to those of the Palaeozoic Microsauri is at least remarkable. They are now practically
  cosmopolitan within the warmer zones, being found in abundance in all intertropical countries and
  islands, even in New Zealand. About two hundred and seventy species are known, which have been
  subdivided into about fifty genera. The generic differences are trivial with few exceptions, and
  refer mostly to the structure of the digits.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The more important features of the vertebral column are the absence of axial joints and the
  persistence and life-long growth of the chorda dorsalis. Each vertebral centrum consists of a
  cartilaginous tube, more or less calcified or ossified, with a narrow waist and a cartilaginous
  septum in the middle. In the tail this septum, which is only slightly invaded by ossification,
  coincides exactly with the line of transverse division of the vertebrae into an anterior and a
  posterior half. This is the level where the tail breaks off and whence it is renewed. Between
  every two successive centra lies an intercentrum, broadest ventrally, crescent- <span
  class="pagenum" id="page504"><span class="smaller">{504}</span></span>or wedge-shaped. Dorsally it
  is continued as fibro-cartilage, and the whole ring acts as an articular pad instead of the joint.
  Chevron-bones are common in the tail.</p>

  <p>The ribs are bifurcated, but the tubercular portion is frequently reduced. The post-thoracic
  ribs are usually very slender, and so long that they meet each other in the middle line, in this
  case bearing an extraordinary resemblance to the so-called "abdominal ribs" of other reptiles.</p>

  <p>The bony frame of the skull is slender. There is a complete absence of bony arches spanning
  over the temporal fossae, or bordering the orbit, which is open posteriorly. The upper jaw, owing
  to the slender and flexible nature of the respective bones, is movable upon the rest of the skull;
  in this respect not unlike the upper jaw of a duck. The dentition is pleurodont and the teeth are
  minute. The eyes of the typical Geckos are peculiar. They are covered with an absolutely
  transparent skin, shaped like a watch-glass, beneath which the eye moves freely, while the true
  upper and lower lids are reduced to tiny folds. The covering "watch-glass" is probably a
  modification of the nictitating membrane. In the Eublepharinae, however, and in the few species of
  the Geckonine genera <i>Aelurosaurus</i> of Borneo and Australia, and <i>Ptenopus</i> of South
  Africa, the upper and lower lids are present and movable. The pupil contracts mostly into a
  vertical slit, except in the few diurnal kinds, e.g. <i>Phelsuma</i>, of the islands in the Indian
  Ocean, and the African <i>Lygodactylus</i>.</p>

  <p>Another peculiarity of at least many Geckos is the extraordinary development of the
  endo-lymphatic sacs of the ear, which, being filled with the chalk-like otoconia or otolithic
  crystals, perforate the skull, and are stowed away in the shape of a pair of large bags behind the
  ears, or on the sides of the neck.</p>

  <p>The skin exhibits considerable variety. It is mostly soft above, with little granular
  tubercles, sometimes containing small dermal ossifications or calcifications. The latter are most
  developed on the head, where they occasionally fuse with the underlying bones. A few species of
  <i>Tarentola</i> possess supra-orbital bones, independent remnants of such osteoderms. The ventral
  surface is generally covered with small imbricating scales, but in some genera, e.g.
  <i>Homopholis</i>, such scales occur also on the dorsal surface, reaching their highest
  development in <i>Teratoscincus</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page507">507</a></span>). In a
  few forms, notably in <i>Ptychozoon</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page505"><span
  class="smaller">{505}</span></span>(<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page512">512</a></span>), the
  skin of the sides of the body and tail is produced into a series of lobes and flaps, the object of
  which seems to assist adhesion. Many, perhaps the majority of Geckos, have adhesive digits, by
  means of which some kinds are enabled to climb absolutely smooth and vertical surfaces, for
  instance a window-pane; or, what is more startling, they run along the smooth, white-washed
  ceiling, back downwards. The apparatus is complicated in its minute detail, but is very simple in
  principle. The adhesion is effected neither by sticky matter, nor in the way described in the
  Anura (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page187">187</a></span>), but by small and numerous vacua.
  The under surface of each digit is furnished with many transverse lamellae. The pressing down of
  the foot upon a smooth surface causes the lamellae to spread asunder and to drive out the air;
  partial retraction lets them return to their original position by virtue of their elasticity; and
  little vacua are produced. Each lamella is further beset with tiny hair-like excrescences, which
  secure adpression to even the slightest irregularity of surface and at the same time enhance the
  elasticity of the pads. The arrangement of the lamellae and pads differs much in the various
  genera. For instance, the lamellae are either broad and entire, or they are divided into two
  parallel rows, with or without lateral hairy fringes; or the under surface of the digits is
  granular, but strongly fringed; or the lamellae are restricted to the dilated tips of the digits,
  etc. The fingers and toes are mostly furnished with sharp, curved claws, and these are in many
  cases retractile between some of the lamellae, or into a special sheath. Those Geckos which live
  on sandy, barren ground are as a rule devoid of adhesive pads, the digits being narrow. The
  typically padded, adhesive digits cause a peculiar sensation when a Gecko hangs on to one's
  finger, and this feeling has perhaps given rise to the erroneous notion of stickiness.</p>

  <p>The tail exhibits many kinds of shape and size. Mostly <span class="pagenum" id="page506"><span
  class="smaller">{506}</span></span>cylindrical and tapering to a point, it is leaf-like in
  <i>Gymnodactylus platurus</i> of Australia; provided with many lobes, and used as a parachute in
  the Malay <i>Ptychozoon</i>. In <i>Nephrurus asper</i> of Eastern Australia the tail is quite
  short, much shorter than the limbs, much swollen at the base, and very thin towards the end, which
  carries a round knob. The tail of all Geckos is very brittle and can be quickly regenerated,
  except the long rat-like tail of the Persian <i>Agamura</i>. In many other desert-forms the tail
  is long, slender, and laterally compressed, acting in such cases like that of desert-forms among
  the Lizards.</p>

  <p>Many Geckos have a voice, mostly rather feeble, and sounding like a soft "click" or "chick"
  produced by our tongue. Repetition of this sound resembles in some species the word "gecko." They
  lay eggs, rather globular, or but slightly oval, hard-shelled, and white, mostly two in number.
  <i>Naultinus elegans</i> of New Zealand is said to be viviparous. The males are generally larger
  than the females, and they are further distinguished by the possession of femoral or pre-anal
  pores.</p>

  <p>All Geckos feed upon animals, chiefly upon insects, but the larger forms take anything they can
  master. With few exceptions they are nocturnal, which, however, does not prevent them from
  occasionally baking themselves in the sun. They are capable of changing colour, but since their
  ground-colour is almost universally grey, yellow, or brown, the range of the colour-changes is
  restricted to the adoption of darker or lighter hues. The skin is shed in flakes and eaten.</p>

  <p>Geckos are absolutely harmless; they cannot even inflict painful bites. However, in many
  countries they are feared as much or even more than the most poisonous snakes. In the south of
  Spain and Portugal, for instance, where Geckos are plentiful in and outside the houses, and are
  consequently objects of daily observation, the "<i>osga</i>" is considered a dreadfully poisonous
  creature. They become very tame, or rather confiding in their regular habits, provided they are
  not molested. If caught&ndash;and they have many enemies among other lizards and snakes&ndash;the
  only safety of these defenceless and mostly small creatures lies in their tail, which, being
  extremely brittle, is left in the claws or jaws of the pursuer. The remaining stump soon produces
  a new tail, in shape and size like the old one, but with a different and simpler scaling. I knew
  of several specimens of <span class="pagenum" id="page507"><span
  class="smaller">{507}</span></span>the Portuguese <i>Platydactylus facetanus</i>, which, having
  lost their tails in the act of being caught, were kept in a box for six weeks without food. On
  their arrival in England they had each grown a new stump nearly half an inch long!</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Geckonidae. Sub-Fam. 1. Geckoninae.</b>&ndash;Vertebrae amphicoelous; parietal bones
  separate; clavicles dilated and perforated. Hereto belong the overwhelming majority of Geckos,
  only a few of which can be mentioned.</p>

  <p><i>Teratoscincus scincus.</i>&ndash;This most peculiar creature, about six inches in length,
  inhabits the steppes of Turkestan and neighbouring desert-regions of Persia. It is a thorough
  desert-form. The digits are devoid of adhesive lamellae, but are granular inferiorly and strongly
  fringed laterally, an arrangement which is rare among Geckos, practically restricted to it with
  <i>Ptenopus</i> and <i>Stenodactylus</i>, which are likewise deserticolous. This is a beautiful
  illustration of adaptation to the surroundings. A Gecko, instead of climbing rocks and trees, has
  lost the climbing apparatus, or has transformed parts of it for running upon loose sand. The body
  is covered with imbricating, rather large and smooth scales. The tail is round at the base,
  compressed in its posterior half, covered below and on the sides with scales like those of the
  body, but on the upper side with a series of large, transverse, nail-like plates. By rubbing these
  plates upon each other, this Gecko produces a shrill, cricket-like noise, sitting at night in
  front of his house, perhaps in order to attract grasshoppers. The noise is made by both sexes.</p>

  <p><i>Ptenopus</i>, a Gecko of Damara Land, likewise adapted to desert-life, produces a similar
  chirping noise by its throat.</p>

  <p><i>Phyllodactylus</i> is a genus of world-wide distribution, occurring in tropical America,
  Africa, Madagascar, and Australia, extending to the Norfolk Islands and to Lord Howe's Island. One
  species, <i>Ph. europaeus</i>, occurs on the islands in the Western Mediterranean. The digits are
  furnished with transverse lamellae, the greater number of which are broken up into small scales
  forming three longitudinal series. The ends of the digits are dilated, with two large plates
  inferiorly, separated by a longitudinal groove into which the claw is retracted. The upper parts
  of the body are covered with juxtaposed scales intermixed with larger tubercles. The abdominal
  scales are small and imbricating. The cylindrical, tapering tail is slightly prehensile, covered
  with <span class="pagenum" id="page508"><span class="smaller">{508}</span></span>small scales
  arranged in verticils. This species is devoid of femoral or anal pores. General colour above
  grey-brown, with darker and lighter markings; a dark streak on the side of the head, passing
  through the eye. Under parts whitish. Total length up to 3 inches. The eggs are almost round,
  measuring 8.7 by 7 mm.</p>

  <p><i>Tarentola mauritanica</i> s. <i>Platydactylus facetanus</i>.&ndash;The digits are strongly
  dilated, with undivided lamellae below, and a flat, nail-like scute on their upper surface near
  the tip. Only the third and fourth digits are clawed. Femoral or pre-anal pores are absent. The
  upper parts are covered with scales and granules, and bear several longitudinal rows of strongly
  keeled, large tubercles; the under parts have hexagonal scales. General colour above
  greyish-brown, with darker or lighter markings; with a dark streak through the eye. Total length
  of large males about 6 inches. This species is one of the commonest Geckos in the Southern
  Mediterranean countries. In Portugal it extends northwards to the Douro. It has been introduced by
  ships into the ports of Cette, Toulon, and Marseilles. It is easily kept in captivity, like most
  Geckos indeed, provided they are supplied with a variety of insect-food, water in the shape of
  drops, and suitable places to hide in. A female, which I had received from Algiers in a little tin
  box, with a lump of meat (presumably its food!), laid two eggs six weeks after its arrival. This
  was towards the end of April. Towards the end of June in the same year it again laid two eggs,
  measuring 13 &times; 10 mm. Another specimen laid in June in two successive years. These and other
  Geckos live very well in a greenhouse, or in a large glass cage. They change colour most
  adaptively. They hunt preferably at night for insects, which are stalked and then suddenly rushed
  at. Drops of water are taken by a lapping motion of the tongue. For sleeping-places they selected
  bits of hollow bamboo, but these had to be vacated when some tree-frogs crept into them for the
  daytime, and the Geckos took to some curved pieces of bark, on the under side of which they slept,
  with their backs downwards. This is, by the way, a favourite position of rest of most Geckos. But
  <i>Stenodactylus guttatus</i> of Egypt lies flat on its belly, tucks the fore-feet under and
  inwards like a cat, rests the head upon them, and stretches the hind-limbs out backwards. The
  little Geckos are rather intelligent. They take no notice of a finger put against the other side
  of the glass to which they happen to cling; but <span class="pagenum" id="page510"><span
  class="smaller">{510}</span></span>when the hand is put inside their cage and approaches them too
  near, they dart off suddenly. When driven into a corner they wriggle and wag their tails, or even
  raise the latter, perhaps as an invitation to grasp it, in which case it would of course break
  off. When caught, they emit feeble sounds, and attempt to bite with the mouth widely open. During
  the moulting, which takes place at least twice a year, in the spring and in the autumn, the skin
  peels off in flakes; if, as happens sometimes, the skin upon the lamellae is not stripped off
  neatly, these refuse to act, and the creature cannot climb until all the old skin has been rubbed
  off.</p>

  <p>In their native haunts they are very regular in their habits. Favourite resorts of theirs are
  old olive trees or oak trees, the rough and cracked bark of which affords excellent places for
  hiding in. Hollow trees are of course preferred. Not a single specimen is seen during the early
  hours of the morning or in the forenoon; but when the sun has become broiling hot, and our own
  shadow passes over the stem of a tree, we become aware of flitting little shadows which jerk over
  its surface. These are Geckos which had been basking, motionless; very dark grey, almost blackish,
  just like the colour of the grey bark upon which the last wet season's moss has been scorched to a
  black cinder. It is difficult to espy a Gecko whilst it is glued on to such a tree. Only the
  little beady eyes betray it, watching you carefully. Nothing appears more easy than to catch that
  motionless thing. You put out your hand and it is gone; like a flash it has moved a foot higher
  up, or down, to the right or to the left, just where you least expected it to go, and there it
  clings on motionless as before. It does not seem to run; it glides along, dodging over to the
  other side of the stem and back again. There is system in its motions, since, taking a last
  leisurely look around, it gently disappears in a rent or hole. Towards the evening, or when the
  shadows become longer, the Geckos become lively. One after another appears on the surface, upon
  the tree, or at the entrance of the cave, and they all move about in their peculiar rushing jerks.
  Spiders, flies, mosquitoes, moths, form the principal diet, and the hunting goes on well into the
  night. Where a gecko has been seen once it is sure to reappear the next day at the same hour.
  Those which take up their abode inside a house become almost domesticated. They are strange sights
  when hunting for flies, <span class="pagenum" id="page511"><span
  class="smaller">{511}</span></span>running up and down the papered walls; but we fairly gasp when
  they come to the upper corner, calmly bend over, and with the next jerk slide along the
  white-washed ceiling. We are accustomed to flies performing such feats, but at animals five inches
  long, supple and fat, we are inclined to draw the line. However, that is the way of Geckos,
  and&ndash;be it confessed&ndash;the more we ponder over the mechanism of their fingers and toes,
  the less we comprehend how such little vacua can support or suspend such heavy creatures from a
  dry and often porous surface.</p>

  <p><i>Gecko.</i>&ndash;The digits are strongly dilated with undivided lamellae. All, except the
  pollex and hallux, have a very short compressed terminal phalanx with a retractile claw. Males
  with femoral or pre-anal pores. This Eastern genus includes some of the largest of all Geckos.</p>

  <p><i>G. stentor</i> of the Malay countries reaches a length of 15 inches. <i>G. verticillatus</i>
  s. <i>verus</i> s. <i>guttatus</i> ranges from Eastern Bengal to China and through the Indian
  archipelago. It grows to about one foot in length. The head is large; the back is covered with
  small granules and about a dozen rows of large tubercles. The tail, when intact, and the belly are
  covered with scales, those of the tail being arranged in transverse rows, several of which make up
  distinct rings. The upper parts of the body are grey or yellowish with red spots and
  vermiculations. According to Theobald<a id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> it lays
  about eight hard-shelled white eggs as big as a musket-ball, cementing them to trees, rocks, or
  secluded buildings. The cry is "touk-tay," several times repeated, and ending in a long-drawn out,
  diminuendo, guttural rumble. This animal does not confine itself to insects, but eats young rats
  also. Dr. Mason has seen it devour smaller species of house-lizards, and Theobald has seen it
  seize a bat flying round the room, and devour it.</p>

  <p>Tennent<a id="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> tells the following story about one
  of these creatures: "In an officer's quarter in the fort of Colombo, a Gecko had been taught to
  come daily to the dinner-table, and always made its appearance along with the dessert. The family
  were absent for some months, during which the house underwent extensive repairs, the roof having
  been raised, the walls stuccoed, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page512"><span
  class="smaller">{512}</span></span>ceilings whitened. It was naturally surmised that so long a
  suspension of its accustomed habits would have led to the disappearance of the little lizard; but
  on the return of its old friends, it made its entrance as usual at their first dinner the instant
  the cloth was removed."</p>

  <p><i>Ptychozoon.</i>&ndash;The digits have the same structure as described in the genus
  <i>Gecko</i>, but they are entirely webbed. The extraordinary feature of <i>Ptychozoon</i> is the
  membranous expansions on the sides of the head, body, limbs, and tail, which are said to act as
  parachutes. <i>P. homalocephalum</i>, the only species, inhabits the Malay Islands and the Malay
  Peninsula. It reaches a length of 8 inches. A specimen obtained by F. H. Bauer in Java, in the
  month of November, laid two eggs a few days after its capture. One young was hatched in the middle
  of the following May, and two days later another came out of the second egg. The characteristic
  folds of the skin were already clearly discernible.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Eublepharinae.</b>&ndash;Differing from the true Geckos by their procoelous
  vertebrae and the fusion of the two parietal bones into one. The eyelids are not reduced, but
  remain functional. This sub-family is undoubtedly a heterogeneous assembly, as indicated by the
  very scattered distribution of its few species (about seven), in India, West Africa, and Central
  America.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Uroplatinae</b>, composed of a few species of the genus <i>Uroplates</i> in
  Madagascar. The distinctive characters of <span class="pagenum" id="page513"><span
  class="smaller">{513}</span></span>these otherwise typical Geckos are the fusion of the nasal
  bones into one, the small size of the interclavicle, and the non-dilated shape of the
  clavicles.</p>

  <p>Neither the Eublepharinae nor the Uroplatinae are more nearly related to other Autosauri than
  are the other Geckos. They are modifications within the sub-order of the Geckones.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 2. Lacertae.</b>&ndash;<i>Autosauri with procoelous, solid vertebrae, and with the
  ventral portions of the clavicles not dilated.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cope,<a id="NtA_153" href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> discarding outer
  appearances as deceptive in the classification of the Lacertae, laid stress upon internal
  characters, notably the presence or absence of osteoderms, the formation of the skull, and the
  structure of the tongue. Boulenger<a id="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> has followed
  and improved upon Cope's arrangement, and has elaborated the classification, which, being used by
  himself in the three volumes of the Catalogue of Lizards in the British Museum, has also been
  followed in the present work, with slight alterations in the order of treatment of the families.
  For our present purpose we diagnose the families as follows, giving preference to such characters
  as are most easily ascertained:&ndash;</p>

  <p>These eighteen "families" of the Lacertae fall into four main groups. We naturally assume that
  the presence of osteoderms and of complete cranial arches indicate more archaic conditions than
  their absence, just as we conclude that limbless forms have been evolved from creatures with fully
  developed limbs. We arrange the four groups with their families as follows:&ndash;</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Agamidae.</b>&ndash;Acrodont, Old-World Lizards, with a broad and short tongue.  The
  teeth are usually differentiated into incisors, canines, and molars. The orbit is closed
  posteriorly; the temporal fossa is bridged over by an arch which is formed chiefly by the
  squamosal and the well-developed jugal; the postorbital mostly remaining small, and the
  postfrontal and supratemporal bones being either absent or not present as separate elements. The
  limbs are well developed. The eye, provided with complete eyelids, is distinctly small and has a
  round pupil. The skin is devoid of osteoderms, although large and numerous spines are often
  present, especially on the head and on the tail. The Agamidae, of which about two hundred species,
  arranged <span class="pagenum" id="page516"><span class="smaller">{516}</span></span>in about
  thirty genera, are known, exhibit a great diversity of mostly flat-bodied, terrestrial and more
  laterally compressed, arboreal forms. The majority are insectivorous, a few Agamas have a mixed
  diet, while <i>Uromastix</i> and some others are chiefly, if not entirely, frugivorous and
  herbivorous. They are an exclusively Old-World family, avoiding the cooler parts of the
  Palaearctic sub-region, and also, a very curious fact, Madagascar. The majority live in Australia
  and in the Indian and Malay countries, comparatively few in Africa, chiefly the genus
  <i>Agama</i>.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 123.</span>&ndash;<i>Draco volans.</i> &times; &#x2154;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Draco</i> ("Flying Dragon").&ndash;The body is much depressed and the sides extend as a pair
  of large wing-like membranes, which are supported by five or six of the much-elongated posterior
  ribs, and can be folded up like a fan. On the throat are three pointed appendages, a short one on
  either side and a long one in the middle. The tail is very long and slender, but not brittle.
  About twenty species of this extraordinary genus inhabit the various Indo-Malayan countries; one,
  <i>D. dussumieri</i>, occurs in Madras. <i>D. volans</i> of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java,
  and Borneo is about 10 inches long, 5 of which are taken up by the tail. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page517"><span class="smaller">{517}</span></span>male has a small nuchal crest. The upper
  parts of this pretty creature have a metallic sheen, with small dark spots and undulating
  cross-bands upon the rich brown ground-colour. The wings are orange with black markings. The gular
  sac of the male is orange, that of the female is blue.</p>

  <p>The "Flying Dragons" use their wings as parachutes, but their sailing powers are said to be
  very moderate. Certainly they do not fly by moving the wings, but when at rest upon a branch,
  amidst the luxurious vegetation and in the immediate neighbourhood of gorgeously coloured flowers,
  which partly conceal them by their likeness, they greatly resemble butterflies, especially since
  they have the habit of opening and folding their pretty wings.</p>

  <p><i>Ceratophora.</i>&ndash;This exclusively Ceylonese genus is remarkable for a flexible, erect,
  and pointed appendage which arises from the top of the snout; it is best developed in the males,
  vestigial or absent in the females. Gular appendages are absent. The trunk is crestless, slightly
  compressed, and covered with partly keeled scales. The tail is slender and very long, about
  two-thirds of the total length of the animal. The general colour is olive-brown, with irregular
  darker markings and with light streaks on the head and thighs. <i>C. stoddarti</i> and <i>C.
  tennenti</i> are about 10 inches long, the former without, the latter with, little scales upon the
  rostral appendage.</p>

  <p><i>Lyriocephalus</i>, with <i>L. scutatus</i> (Fig. 124) of Ceylon as the only species, is
  remarkable for its Chameleon-like appearance. A splendid case of convergent evolution, but most
  improbably of mimicry. The tympanum is quite hidden. The head is raised into a pair of sharp bony
  edges. On the top of the nose is a thick globular lump, recalling the genus <i>Ceratophora</i>,
  and also various Malagasy Chameleons. The back and sides are covered with very small granular
  scales, intermixed with several rows of enlarged scales as in <i>Chameleo pumilus</i>, and there
  is a serrated crest along the back from neck to tail. The under parts are covered with large
  keeled scales with sharp points directed backwards, especially on the tail. The whole body is
  laterally compressed. The pollex and the fifth toe are strongly opposed to the other digits. The
  general colour is greenish above, whitish below. Total length about one foot.</p>

  <p><i>Calotes</i>, with many species in India and in the Malay Islands, is distinguished by a
  crest on the neck and back. Many of the males have a gular sac. The tail is extremely long. These
  lizards are remarkable for their changes of colour.</p>

  <p><i>C. versicolor</i> ranges from Afghanistan through the whole of India to Southern China, and
  attains a length of 14 inches, 11 of which are taken up by the tail. It possesses no gular sac,
  but has a well-developed crest. The whole body and tail are covered with strongly keeled scales.
  When the lizard is irritated, or swallowing its food, the head and neck become brilliant red,
  whilst the usually brownish tint of the body is converted into pale yellow. Mr. Annandale has
  favoured me with the following observations on <i>C. emma</i>:&ndash;"In the Malay Peninsula the
  Europeans misname this lizard Chameleon. The colour-changes appear to be brought about by
  emotions, although the lizard is often darker towards <span class="pagenum" id="page519"><span
  class="smaller">{519}</span></span>evening than it is at mid-day. The males are very pugnacious,
  and change colour as they fight. At the time of courtship a curious performance is gone through by
  the male, the female remaining concealed in the foliage hard by. He chooses some convenient
  station, such as a banana leaf or the top of a fence, and advances slowly towards the female. His
  colour is then pale yellowish flesh-colour, with a conspicuous dark spot on each of the gular
  pouches, which are extended to their utmost. He stands upright, raising the fore part of the body
  as high as possible, and nodding his head solemnly up and down. As he does so, the mouth is
  rapidly and repeatedly opened and shut, but no sound is emitted. When he is driven away, caught or
  killed, the dark spot disappears entirely from the neck. If one male is captured, another takes
  his place within a few hours."</p>

  <p><i>C. ophiomachus</i> of Southern India and Ceylon reaches 2 feet in length, has a fold of skin
  in front of each shoulder, and is generally known as the "blood-sucker" on account of the red
  colour displayed during excitement on the head and neck.</p>

  <p><i>C. mystaceus</i>, chiefly in Burma and Siam, but also in the Nicobar Islands and in Ceylon,
  has a small gular sac and an oblique fold in front of each shoulder. The specific name seems to
  refer to the yellowish lips. Mason<a id="NtA_155" href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> gives the
  following vivid account of it:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"This is a very common species in gardens in Toung-ngoo. A pair made their home in the mango
  trees near my study window. The female blundered into the house a few days ago, but I found her a
  very unattractive animal of a uniform earth-brown colour. The male, however, is sometimes a
  beauty. He may be often seen jerking his head up and down, with the head, pouch, and whole front
  of the body a glowing ultramarine blue, contrasting beautifully with the reddish-brown of the
  hinder part of the body and tail. From the nose to the shoulders, below the eye, is a broad white
  band, which is interrupted by three reddish-brown patches, in line with the white band, before
  reaching the uniform reddish brown of the hinder part of the body. Occasionally the white band
  below the eye assumes a brownish colour, and the animal appears to have a brown band down each
  side. He does not always, however, appear in this gay dress. While I am writing, I see him coming
  down the trunk of one of the trees <span class="pagenum" id="page520"><span
  class="smaller">{520}</span></span>in a very faded garment. His skin suggests a bright calico
  after it has been washed, whose colours succumb to soap. The blue is there, but it is no longer
  the bright blue of yesterday. It has changed to a dull light indigo colour. He runs across the
  grass to the foot of another tree, and stops on the bare ground at its base, where for a minute or
  more he bites with great energy at a struggling grasshopper, and while thus exercising himself the
  blue fades out from his body altogether, and his whole body takes the colour of the brown earth on
  which he stands. After tarrying a minute or two he ran up the other tree, and the dull light blue
  colour seemed to return to him."</p>

  <p><i>Agama</i> with many species in Africa and Asia; some in South-Eastern Europe. The body is
  somewhat depressed. There is a fold across the throat and a pit on either side; the presence of a
  gular sac is variable. A dorsal crest is absent or but feebly developed. The males have pre-anal
  pores.</p>

  <p><i>A. sanguinolenta.</i>&ndash;The body is covered with strongly keeled and pointed scales. On
  the sides of the head are a few spine-like scales. The ear-opening is partly concealed by a fringe
  of spinous scales. The males have a gular pouch. This is a typical inhabitant of the deserts and
  steppes of Turkestan. Zander<a id="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> has observed the
  habits and many changes of colour of this lizard. The usual garb is earthy brown above, with
  somewhat darker and rather indistinct markings. The under parts are whitish. Sometimes the
  creature changes to dirty white, at other times into blackish or grey brown. Bluish-red stripes
  may appear on the sides of the body; blue lines begin to show on the throat, and ultimately the
  whole belly, originally white, may become ultramarine blue. When the general tone happens to be
  sulphurous yellow, blue often appears on the tail and limbs. Brick red appears on four
  longitudinal rows of patches on the sides of the body. Sometimes the whole animal assumes a vinous
  tinge, or it is at first greenish before turning into blue. The change begins on the tail and
  limbs, extends over the head, and at length reaches the back. Red appears in both sexes, more
  frequently in the female; blue almost entirely in the male. Sunlight and warmth only intensify the
  colours. Adaptive coloration, besides the usual sandy garb, has not been observed. The lizards
  live on soil which is baked as hard as bricks, or in <span class="pagenum" id="page521"><span
  class="smaller">{521}</span></span>cavities of old walls, provided there is vegetation. They
  require vegetable food, besides insects, grazing on grass, and having a fondness also for
  <i>Mesembryanthemum cardiforme</i>. Very large males reach a total length of one foot. They are
  pugnacious, especially during the time of breeding. The male inflates its gular sac into the size
  of a walnut, stands up upon its four limbs, with its head slightly lowered and turned to one side.
  Then it darts upon the foe which it has been eyeing for some time.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>A. stellio</i> is the commonest Agama in Egypt, Asia Minor, and in some of the Grecian
  Islands, where the Greeks still call it <i>korkordilos</i>, just as they did in the time of old
  Herodotus. The Arabic name is <i>hardun</i>. This lizard is easily recognised by the irregular
  folds on the neck, which are beset with spinous horny scales. It grows to a length of 15 inches.
  The general colour is brown, with dark patches on the back. When basking they become almost black;
  in the breeding season the male assumes red tints on the head and neck.</p>

  <p><i>Phrynocephalus.</i>&ndash;This is a typical Agamoid of the steppes and deserts of Asia.  The
  head is short and thick, the ear is <span class="pagenum" id="page522"><span
  class="smaller">{522}</span></span>hidden. The body is depressed, devoid of a dorsal crest; on the
  throat is a transverse fold but no sac.</p>

  <p>A. Zander<a id="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> has made interesting observations
  upon the habits of several species.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. helioscopus</i> lives on hard stretches of soil, which are absolutely bare of
  vegetation, the soil being baked as hard as a paved road. The lizards live on any insects they can
  get hold of, chiefly, however, upon mining ants. When chased they run with short jerks, carrying
  the tail high or rolled up.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. interscapularis</i> occurs, in Transcaspia, on the shifting, loose sand. It runs so fast
  that one scarcely sees anything but its shadow. The tail is rolled upwards. With short jerks it
  suddenly changes its direction, stops behind a few blades of grass, or in the open, makes a few
  shaking, wavy movements, and covers itself lightly with sand. Shortly after that the top of the
  head appears, the grains of sand rolling off between the strong supraciliary ridges, and the
  little creature, only about 3 inches long, peeps out of its temporary hiding-place.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. mystaceus</i>, which inhabits Transcaspia and parts of Southern Russia, often faces its
  aggressor, raising itself upon its fore-limbs, curling and uncurling its tail in its excitement,
  and holding its mouth widely open. The creature, which attains a length of 9 inches, inclusive of
  the long tail, then assumes a markedly changed aspect. The flaps of skin at the corners of the
  mouth swell up into a half-moon-shaped transverse plate, the hinder surface of which is covered by
  the outer skin, while the front is a continuation of the rosy lining of the mouth, which thereby
  appears hugely enlarged. When biting it hangs firmly on to the finger. This frightening attitude
  is interesting, since it occurs in a much more developed condition in the following genus.</p>

  <p><i>Chlamydosaurus kingi.</i>&ndash;This peculiar Agamoid, which inhabits Queensland and
  Northern and North-Western Australia, is easily recognised by the large frill-shaped dermal
  expansion on either side of the neck. The two halves are confluent on the throat. The whole frill
  can be erected, and is worked by the much-elongated arches or horns of the hyoid apparatus, which
  extend into the flaps of skin, somewhat like the ribs of an umbrella. The specially modified
  hyoidean muscles spread out <span class="pagenum" id="page523"><span
  class="smaller">{523}</span></span>and fold the frill. When this curious creature is pursued it
  folds the frill and runs in a semi-erect position upon its hind-limbs, with its fore-limbs hanging
  down. However, it cannot keep up this peculiar gait for long, and it then suddenly turns to bay,
  frequently at the root of a tree, which it can climb with ease. When standing at bay it spreads
  out the shield to its full extent, in the middle of which appears the widely opened mouth, which
  is red inside and armed with powerful teeth. Altogether this lizard presents a formidable aspect,
  and is an enemy not to be despised, considering that it is strongly built and grows to nearly 3
  feet in length. For a further account of the habits and of the mechanism of the frill see De
  Vis.<a id="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Physignathus.</i>&ndash;This is a water-loving genus, inhabiting well-watered districts with
  luxuriant vegetation in Australia, Papuasia, Siam, and Cochin China. The body and the very long
  tail are laterally compressed and furnished with a low, serrated crest. <i>Ph. lesueuri</i> of
  Queensland reaches a length of about 18 inches. The general colour is dark olive above, with
  darker and lighter <span class="pagenum" id="page524"><span
  class="smaller">{524}</span></span>cross-bands, and with a broad black band reaching from the eye
  to the shoulder. The under parts are pale olive, with small black dots. The throat, although
  devoid of a special sac, is frequently bulged out by the hyoid apparatus, as shown in Fig. 127,
  taken from a specimen in the Zoological Gardens in London.</p>

  <p><i>Uromastix</i> is a typical desert-form, inhabiting the dry and sandy tracts of North Africa,
  Arabia, Syria, Persia, and North-Western India. The genus is easily recognised by the short and
  thick tail, which is covered with whorls of large spinous scales, while the much-depressed body
  and head are almost smooth, being covered with very small scales. The tympanum of the ear is quite
  exposed. The incisors are large, uniting in the adult into one or two pairs of large cutting
  teeth, separated from the molars by a toothless space. There is a transverse fold on the throat.
  Pre-anal and femoral pores are well developed.</p>

  <p>These "Spiny-tailed Lizards" live chiefly upon vegetable food, leaves, grass and fruit, but
  they vary this diet with insects, at least in captivity, where they become rather partial to
  meal-worms. They are absolutely terrestrial and diurnal, preferring sandy places, where they bask
  or rather roast themselves in the sun; for the night, at the approach of rain, or on dull and
  chilly days, they retire into their burrows, which they dig in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page525"><span class="smaller">{525}</span></span>the sand or in the hard ground, unless they
  hide in the cracks of rocks. They have a regular mania for digging with their strong limbs and
  short, curved claws. Although they love a great amount of heat, and become stiff when cooled down
  to about 16&deg; C. = 60 F., they can stand several degrees of dry frost without injury. During the
  cold season they hibernate. The spiny tail is used for defence. The lizard lies as a rule in such
  a position in its hole that the tail blocks the narrow passage; when touched with the hand it
  deals out jerky side-blows with the tail. The bite is deliberate and very painful.</p>

  <p><i>U. hardwicki</i> is a native of North-Western India and Beluchistan, occurring especially in
  Sindh and Rajputana, for instance near Delhi and Agra. This species is of a delicate sandy colour,
  with dark dots or vermiculations, interspersed, occasionally, with pale blue specks. The under
  parts are whitish on the tail with a greenish hue. A distinctive and obvious mark is a large
  blackish patch on the anterior side of the thigh. Total length up to one foot.</p>

  <p>I have several times received consignments of the Indian Spiny-tailed Lizard through the
  kindness of friends, but I must confess that they are far less easily kept than one is led to
  believe from certain exaggerated accounts. They are lovely, most interesting, and surprisingly
  tame creatures. I received one lot in the month of June. They made burrows in the dry soil, basked
  in the sun and on the grassy sods of their roomy cage, and showed great curiosity. When
  approached, they at first scrambled off or sank down flat, shut their eyes and feigned death. They
  then opened their tiny yellow eyes a little, while others peeped out of their retreats to see if
  all was safe, or attracted by some noise. Soon they became so tame that they crawled over my hand.
  But the difficulty consisted in feeding them. They greedily lapped up drops of water. Their dung
  consisted of the indigestible parts of some species of <i>Equisetum</i> or Mare's tail, mixed with
  fragments of beetles and ants. Lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, grass, the flowers of red and white
  clover, Mare's tail, wheat, rice, and Indian corn were offered, but they only took a few blades of
  grass and the hard Indian corn, besides meal-worms. This is all the more astonishing since other
  specimens are known to partake freely of herbaceous food. None of them survived the late autumn,
  and most of them succumbed to a disease <span class="pagenum" id="page526"><span
  class="smaller">{526}</span></span>known as intussusception of the gut. They certainly could not
  complain of the want of heat, since the bottom of their cage was kept permanently warm by a lamp,
  and in the autumn they invariably slept in the warmest part of the soil, avoiding the cool regions
  which would have given them a chance of hibernating.</p>

  <p>Another consignment arrived in the month of February. None of them ate anything or survived the
  early summer.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>U. acanthinurus</i> and <i>U. spinipes</i> are common in Algeria, Tunis, and Egypt, where
  they prefer sandy and rocky localities. Their Arabic name is <i>Dab</i>. In Algeria they are
  sometimes called "l&eacute;zards des palmiers," perhaps because they eat dates, besides berries, grass,
  and various flowers. Very large specimens attain a length of 18 inches. Like the other species of
  <i>Uromastix</i> they have no voice. The African species can change colour to a great extent. At a
  low temperature they are mostly grey or brownish black above, dirty white below. When it is warmer
  they change to lighter shades of brown or even to orange yellow and to green, with black or brown
  specks and vermiculations. <span class="pagenum" id="page527"><span
  class="smaller">{527}</span></span>A young specimen of <i>U. acanthinurus</i> has been observed to
  grow within twelve months from 90 to 150 mm. in length.</p>

  <p><i>Moloch.</i>&ndash;The mouth of this peculiar-looking creature is very small; the lateral
  teeth of the upper-jaw are implanted horizontally and directed inwards. The body is much
  depressed, and, like the short tail and head, is covered with small scales or tubercles intermixed
  with large spines. <i>M. horridus</i>, the only species, inhabits the sandy districts of Western
  and Southern Australia. Nothing is known about its habits except that it seems to live upon ants.
  Its extremely rough skin is, according to an accidental observation by Dr. Willey, highly
  hygroscopic. He happened to put a live specimen into a shallow dish with water, when, to his
  surprise, the water was sucked up as by blotting-paper.</p>

  <p><i>Liolepis.</i>&ndash;The body is depressed, without a crest, and is covered with minute
  granular scales. The tail is long, and has small keeled scales. There is a strong transverse gular
  fold, and a fold along the side of the body. The tympanum is distinct. Femoral, but no pre-anal,
  pores are present.</p>

  <p><i>L. belli</i>, the only species, about 18 inches long when full grown, is a native of
  South-Eastern Asia. The general colour is brownish, with pale black-edged spots along the back;
  the sides are marked with black and orange vertical bars; the under parts are orange, variegated
  with blue. Annandale remarks that this is perhaps the commonest lizard on the barren stretches of
  sand in Lower Siam, especially near the coast. It is exceedingly active and timid. Though its
  colour is brilliant, the green and <span class="pagenum" id="page528"><span
  class="smaller">{528}</span></span>grey eye-like spots which ornament its back, and the orange and
  purple stripes on its sides, are not conspicuous amidst the natural surroundings, the former
  harmonising with the shadows cast upon the sand by the scanty vegetation which it supports, and
  the latter being more or less concealed by the folds into which the skin that covers the ribs
  naturally falls. When the male is roughly handled and is unable to use its powerful jaws, it
  flattens its body in such a way that the stripes become most conspicuous. The female is unable to
  do this with such effect, as her ribs do not seem to be so mobile and her colours are less bright.
  <i>Liolepis</i> lives in holes in the ground, which often go down vertically for more than 2 feet
  before there is a bend in their course. Each burrow generally contains a pair of these lizards,
  which, according to the natives, are strictly monogamous.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Iguanidae.</b>&ndash;Pleurodont lizards with a short and thick, non-protractile
  tongue; almost entirely American, with the remarkable exception of two genera, <i>Hoplurus</i> and
  <i>Chalarodon</i> in Madagascar, and one, <i>Brachylophus</i>, in the Fiji Islands. Most of the
  Iguanidae are insectivorous, but some of the most striking forms are herbivorous, e.g.
  <i>Iguana</i>, <i>Amblyrhynchus</i>, and <i>Basiliscus</i>. In their general structure the
  Iguanidae closely resemble the Agamidae, from which they differ chiefly by the pleurodont
  dentition. The orbit is surrounded by bone, and the temporal fossa is bridged over by an arch
  which is formed by the junction of the squamosal chiefly with the postorbital, the jugal taking as
  a rule less share in the arch. Dermal ossifications are absent on the body.</p>

  <p>There are about three hundred different species, which have been grouped into about fifty
  genera, representing arboreal, terrestrial, burrowing, semi-aquatic forms, and even one
  semi-marine species. Their external appearance varies consequently within wide limits.</p>

  <p><i>Anolis</i> is distinguished by the partial dilatation on the middle phalanges, which carry a
  series of transverse adhesive lamellae. In its general shape <i>Anolis</i> resembles slenderly
  built and long-tailed Lacertidae, which it may be said to represent in tropical and sub-tropical
  America, inclusive of the West Indian Islands. The males have a large gular appendage, which can
  be distended by the hyoid bones. <i>Anolis</i> is an expert climber, living in trees, or rushing
  about on fences or walls of houses in search of insects; <span class="pagenum" id="page529"><span
  class="smaller">{529}</span></span>most species can change colour to a great extent. More than a
  hundred species are known, of which we mention only one, very common in the Southern United
  States.</p>

  <p><i>A. carolinensis</i> of the South-Eastern United States and of Cuba is beautiful golden green
  on the whole upper surface; the gular sac becomes vermilion when stretched; when flaccid, it is
  white with occasional red lines and spots. The under parts are white. In cold weather and in
  confinement this little lizard, which is scarcely 6 inches in length, appears dark brown,
  sometimes with a white line along the back. The changes of colour are very sudden. They are
  thoroughly arboreal, leaping from leaf to leaf like Tree-frogs.</p>

  <p>In <i>Anolis</i>, <i>Polychrus</i>, <i>Hoplurus</i>, <i>Chalarodon</i>, <i>Liosaurus</i>, and a
  few others, the posterior ribs are much elongated and imbedded in the abdominal muscles, often
  reaching the medioventral line, a feature elsewhere known in the Geckos only.</p>

  <p><i>Polychrus.</i>&ndash;The body is laterally compressed, covered with small scales, but devoid
  of crests. The digits are likewise compressed, with keeled lamellae on the under surface and with
  four large scales at the base of each claw. Both sexes have femoral pores. The male possesses a
  small gular sac. A few species in Tropical America.</p>

  <p><i>P. marmoratus</i> in South America, where it is often called the Chameleon on account of its
  power of changing colour. The tail is nearly three times as long as the head and body, and is
  covered with keeled scales. The general colour of this arboreal creature, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page530"><span class="smaller">{530}</span></span>which reaches a length of 18 inches, is
  green, but the hues are very variable, and within a short time the creature can change into dull
  brown, with or without blackish spots and bands, or with whitish spots and black lines on the head
  and other parts of the body.</p>

  <p><i>Basiliscus</i> is remarkable for the high and erectile crests which are developed on the
  back and tail of the males. The toes are bordered on the outer side with small lobes. The limbs
  are long, the hind-limbs when stretched forwards reaching the tip of the snout.  Several species
  in Central America and the adjoining countries to the south.</p>

  <p><i>B. americanus</i> reaches the considerable length of nearly 3 feet. The male has a crest on
  the top of the head, and this is produced backwards into a leathery lobe. The back is adorned with
  a very high crest; the folds and dark-coloured marks in which give, in the accompanying
  illustration, the impression that the crest is supported by spines. The long tail carries a
  similar crest. The general colour of the "Basilisc" is green and brown with dark cross-bars on the
  back. The crest of the male is said to be red. These creatures are very common amidst the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page531"><span class="smaller">{531}</span></span>luxuriant vegetation on the
  banks of the rivers of the Tierra Caliente of Mexico and in Guatemala. They lie upon the branches
  of trees, preferring those which overhang the water, into which they plunge at the slightest
  alarm. The high crests, being restricted to the male sex, are not essential to their swimming;
  they propel themselves by rapid strokes of the fore-limbs, letting the long rudder-like tail drag
  behind. The eggs, measuring 20 by 13 mm., are laid in April or May, and are hidden in a hole at
  the base of a tree. About one dozen make a set, and they are said to be hatched within a very
  short time. Owing to their being strictly herbivorous, these pretty and striking-looking creatures
  do not endure captivity in Europe, unless indeed their particular food can be procured.</p>

  <p><i>Iguana.</i>&ndash;The body and tail are laterally compressed and are covered with very small
  scales, while those on the top of the head are large. The neck and back carry a high crest, which
  is composed of separate, laterally compressed, soft spines. A similar but lower crest borders the
  anterior edge of the large gular sac, which is not dilatable. The lateral teeth are remarkable for
  their finely serrated or denticulated anterior and posterior edges. Both sexes have long rows of
  femoral pores. Only two species in Tropical America, absolutely herbivorous. Their delicate flesh
  is much esteemed as food.</p>

  <p><i>I. tuberculata</i> (Fig. 132), of South and Central America and the West Indies, reaches a
  length of 5 to 6 feet. The general colour of the upper parts is a mixture of green and blackish,
  frequently speckled with white or yellow, and there is usually a pale band in front of each arm.
  The flanks are marked with dark, light-edged bars. The under parts are pale greenish or whitish.
  The Iguanas live in the trees, and when there is danger they jump into the water whatever the
  height of the tree, coming down with violence. In going up some of the narrow, unfrequented creeks
  in the Mosquito country, according to Napier Bell,<a id="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> the voyager often encounters quite a shower of falling
  Iguanas, and runs some risk of getting his neck broken. Large specimens, 6 feet long, weigh
  perhaps 30 lbs. They burrow deep horizontal holes in the sloping side of a bank. About two dozen
  eggs, nearly 2 inches long, are laid in a hole, where they are hatched in the month of May.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page532"><span class="smaller">{532}</span></span></div>

  <p>Iguanas are often brought to the markets, either lashed lengthwise to a branch of the tree on
  which the specimen happened to be surprised, or tied up with the long tendons of their own
  toes.</p>

  <p><i>Metopoceros cornutus</i> of Hayti is closely allied to <i>Iguana</i>, but the male has three
  conical horn-like scales on its head. The general colour of the whole animal, which grows to more
  than one yard in length, is dull black.</p>

  <p>The following two genera, each containing one species only, are restricted to the Galapagos
  Islands. Darwin<a id="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> gives a long and vividly
  written account of their habits.</p>

  <p><i>Conolophus subcristatus.</i>&ndash;Fully grown specimens are a yard long. Their shape is
  stout, the head and fore part of the body appearing especially heavy. The head is covered, or
  rather paved, with large cobble-stone-like scales. On the neck is a low crest of recurved spines,
  while the median line of the back appears simply serrated. All the teeth are trilobate. A gular
  sac is absent. The coloration is striking. The head is lemon-yellow; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page533"><span class="smaller">{533}</span></span>the back is red, merging into dark brown on
  the flanks. The belly is dark yellow with a tinge of reddish brown.</p>

  <p>This lizard was found by Darwin on some of the Galapagos Islands. On James' Island it was so
  common that the party found it difficult to pitch their tent, on account of the ground being
  undermined by the many burrows of the reptiles. They feed during the daytime upon the succulent
  cactus and the leaves of various trees. The perfectly harmless creatures are, or were, eaten by
  the inhabitants.</p>

  <p><i>Amblyrhynchus cristatus</i> is closely allied to <i>Conolophus</i>, of which it may be said
  to be an aquatic modification. The top of the blunt head is covered with low, conical, broad-based
  scales. Over the neck, back, and tail extends a continuous crest of low, recurved, spiny scales.
  All the teeth are trilobate. The body and even more so the tail are laterally compressed. The
  general colour is dark brown above, paler and inclining to whitish below. Younger specimens have
  pale grey spots and blackish cross-bands on the back and sides. Total length up to 4 feet. The
  remarkable feature of this Iguanoid is its semi-marine life. It inhabits the rocky and sandy
  strips of coast of most of the Galapagos Islands, feeding upon certain kinds of algae, which it
  has to dive for, since these plants grow below tide-marks.</p>

  <p><i>Phrynosoma</i> ("Horned Toads").&ndash;The body of these little creatures is much flattened
  and broadened, devoid of a dorsal crest, but covered with larger and smaller, strongly keeled
  scales. The head is bordered posteriorly by conspicuous osseous spines. The under parts are
  covered with small, very regular scales. Both sexes have a long row of pores on the under surface
  of the thighs. The general colour of the upper parts is a mixture of yellow, grey, brown, and
  black, the larger spiny scales causing the animal to look as if it were sprinkled with the dried
  husks of seeds, for instance those of Buckwheat. The object is concealment, by close adaptation to
  the arid, sandy localities which are the home of "Horned Toads." About one dozen species inhabit
  the western half of the United States and Central America. All the species are viviparous, almost
  the only instance among Iguanidae.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. cornutum</i> has five spikes on each side of the head: one postorbital, three temporal,
  and one occipital, the latter being by far the largest. The sides of the lower jaw project in the
  shape <span class="pagenum" id="page534"><span class="smaller">{534}</span></span>of prominent
  ledges, and are protected by a series of small spines. The ventral scales are keeled. The under
  parts are yellowish, frequently with a few brown spots. This species, which grows to a length of 5
  inches, ranges from Illinois through Kansas and Texas to Northern Mexico.</p>

  <p><i>Ph. coronatum</i>, an inhabitant of California, has an additional smaller spine between the
  two large occipitals. The scales of the belly are quite smooth.</p>

  <p>These peculiar-looking and interesting creatures recall some of the extinct Dinosaurs in the
  curious configuration of their head: small miniatures indeed. In order to be kept in good health,
  and to be observed properly, they require, above all, warmth, sunshine to bask in, sand to burrow
  in, and proper food. The latter consists of all kinds of small insects, the necessary variety of
  which is best procured by making sweepings with a butterfly-net in a meadow. They take
  green-flies, house-flies, ants, smooth caterpillars, small moths, meal-worms, wood-lice, etc. The
  food is snapped up very quickly by a flash of the tongue, which can be turned out, almost like
  that of a frog, but only to the extent of half an inch. Water in the shape of dew, or drops, is
  absolutely necessary. When in good condition, they defaecate regularly every alternate day.</p>

  <p>They love to bask in the broiling sun, heating themselves well through; and in the afternoon,
  long before sunset, when the sand is warmed up to 40&deg; C., or fever-heat, they prepare to go to
  bed. For this they select a dry and soft spot, and within a few minutes manage to dig themselves
  in flat, literally sinking into the sand by pushing themselves forwards, and by shovelling the
  sand upon their backs with peculiar motions of the fringed sides of their flat bodies. Sometimes
  the spines of the head remain sticking out, looking like dry thorns scattered over the sand. To
  prevent the latter from getting into the nostrils, these are provided with closely-fitting valves.
  Thus they remain concealed during the night, and not until the sun is well up do they leave their
  hiding-place, first peeping out, and then raising their head and neck, letting the sand roll off
  between the spines. Still half concealed, the back covered with little pebbles, seeds, or bits of
  dry leaves, they wait for a long time before they feel lively enough to sally forth. Although
  mostly slow and deliberate in their movements, stalking about with arched back, and raised upon
  the fore-limbs, they can run fast enough for a few yards before they stop again and nod in a
  ridiculous way. When they see themselves observed, they shut their eyes and slowly sink <span
  class="pagenum" id="page536"><span class="smaller">{536}</span></span>down. On cool and dull days
  they do not appear at all, and during part of the cooler season they require artificial heat until
  they are ready to hibernate. Unless they are allowed to hibernate, they will keep on feeding
  through the winter, but in that case are sure to die in the following spring.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Xenosauridae</b>, with <i>Xenosaurus grandis</i> in Southern Mexico as the sole
  species, seems to connect the Iguanidae with the Anguidae. According to Boulenger, its affinity to
  the former is shown by the <span class="sans fwb">T</span>-shaped interclavicle, the absence of
  symmetrical bony shields on the head and of osteodermal plates on the body. Affinity to the
  Anguidae is indicated first by the short tongue, which has a narrow, feebly incised, retractile
  anterior part, covered with flat papillae; secondly, by the teeth, which, instead of being hollow
  at the base, are solid; lastly, by the palatine bones, which are widely separated.</p>

  <p><i>X. grandis</i>, scarcely one foot in length. The body is depressed, covered above with
  minute granules and tubercles, below with smooth scales. A distinct fold of skin extends from the
  axilla to the groin, recalling the more strongly developed lateral fold of some of the
  Anguidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Zonuridae.</b>&ndash;This family, comprising four genera with about one dozen
  species in South and Tropical Africa, and in Madagascar, likewise seems to connect Iguanidae and
  Anguidae. It is distinguished from the former by dermal ossifications, which roof over the
  supratemporal fossa; from the latter by the tongue, the hollow teeth, and, in <i>Zonurus</i> at
  least, by the occurrence of dermal ossifications on the trunk and tail. The tongue is short,
  villose, scarcely protractile, entire, or but feebly nicked at the tip. The Zonuridae may
  therefore be defined as <i>pleurodont African lizards with a short tongue, and with a bony roof to
  the supratemporal fossae</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Zonurus.</i>&ndash;The whole head, back, and tail are covered with bony scales, the horny
  covering of which forms very sharp spikes, especially on the tail. The body is depressed. The
  ear-opening is large. South Africa, in dry and rocky localities; one species, <i>Z.
  tropidosternum</i>, in Madagascar.</p>

  <p><i>Z. giganteus</i> s. <i>derbianus</i>, with strong spikes on the occiput, neck, and tail.
  General colour yellowish brown. Total length about 15 inches.</p>

  <p><i>Chamaesaura</i> of South Africa closely approaches the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page537"><span class="smaller">{537}</span></span>Anguidae by its snake-shaped body, extremely
  long tail, and vestigial limbs. In <i>Ch. aenea</i> both pairs of limbs are still present and
  pentadactyle, but are very small; in <i>Ch. anguina</i> the limbs are reduced to little styliform
  stumps; and in <i>Ch. macrolepis</i> they are altogether absent. The scales of the body and tail
  are strongly keeled and imbricating, but are devoid of dermal ossifications. Total length up to 2
  feet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Anguidae.</b>&ndash;Pleurodont lizards with osteoderms, and with the tongue composed
  of two distinct portions, of which the anterior is thin, emarginate, extensible, and retractile
  into the posterior thicker portion. The supratemporal fossa is roofed in by dermal bones. The
  whole body is protected by bony plates underlying the imbricating scales. The teeth vary much in
  shape, but they are always solid, the new teeth not growing into the base of the old ones, but
  between them. The limbs are in a very unstable condition, there being in the family a general
  tendency to reduce and lose the limbs. The shoulder- and pelvic-girdle however remain, although
  sometimes merely vestigial. The tail is long, very brittle, and easily reproduced. All the
  Anguidae are strictly terrestrial, and live on animal diet. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page538"><span class="smaller">{538}</span></span>Some <i>Anguis</i>, at least, are
  viviparous. The distribution of the seven genera, with some forty species, is very scattered. The
  majority, chiefly <i>Gerrhonotus</i>, inhabit Central America, a few occur farther north and
  south&ndash;two, <i>Anguis fragilis</i> and <i>Pseudopus pallasi</i>, in Europe, and one in the
  Himalayas and in Burmah.</p>

  <p><i>Gerrhonotus</i> has a pair of deep longitudinal folds, each of which extends from the region
  of the neck along the side of the body towards the tail. The four limbs are well developed and
  pentadactyle. The teeth are conical. Many species, mostly in Central America. <i>G. coeruleus</i>
  has the widest range, extending from Costa Rica to Vancouver. It is also one of the largest
  species, reaching a length of more than one foot. The tail is nearly twice as long as the rest of
  the body. General colour above brown with blackish bars and spots, especially on the more
  yellowish flanks; under parts whitish with a greenish tinge, often with brown spots arranged in
  longitudinal rows.</p>

  <p><i>Ophisaurus</i> s. <i>Pseudopus</i> is closely allied to the previous genus, being possessed
  of the same kind of deep lateral folds; the limbs are, however, reduced to a pair of tiny spikes,
  half concealed at the sides of the anal cleft. The teeth are conical, and in the adult have
  somewhat flattened crowns. The body and tail are very long and snake-like, but the head is that of
  a typical Lizard.</p>

  <p><i>O. apus</i> s. <i>Pseudopus pallasi</i>, the Glass-Snake of the Balkan Peninsula, South
  Russia, Asia Minor, and Morocco, grows to more than one yard in length, of which about two-thirds
  belong to the tail. The general colour is brown above, paler below. Young specimens are olive-grey
  with dark brown cross-bands on the back. <i>O. gracilis</i> inhabits the Eastern Himalayas and
  Burmah, the others live in North America.</p>

  <p>The "Glass-Snake" inhabits bushy localities, where it can hide under the fallen leaves and in
  the sand; it cannot climb, and avoids the water. Its movements resemble those of a snake, but are
  far less graceful, owing to the stiff armour in which the whole body is encased. The food consists
  chiefly of snails, the shells of which are crushed, and of mice, but nothing comes amiss which can
  be mastered, namely insects, worms, small lizards, young birds, and vipers. The prey, when caught,
  is rapidly twisted round and round, or shaken until it is giddy or stunned, whereupon the
  Glass-Snake proceeds to chew it with its powerful jaws, and then to swallow it in pieces. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page539"><span class="smaller">{539}</span></span>Although it can bite so
  well, it never does so when caught, but resorts to the much more disagreeable defence of twisting
  itself around one's hand and arm, and besmearing them with its disgustingly stinking excrements.
  Those who have observed Glass-snakes praise their tameness, and the intelligent way in which they
  hunt about in search of their food. They lay eggs under moss and leaves, and the young seem to
  require many years to grow up.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Anguis</i>, with only one species, <i>A. fragilis</i>, the "Slow-worm" or "Blind-worm," is
  devoid of a lateral fold. Limbs are entirely absent. The whole body is covered with smooth
  roundish scales, with a substratum of dermal ossifications. The teeth are curved backwards,
  fang-shaped, and have a very faint longitudinal groove on their anterior surface. The ear-opening
  is very minute, more or less hidden by surrounding scales. The eyes are perfectly well developed,
  provided with movable lids, and it does not speak well for the power of observation of most people
  that this creature should generally be known as the "Blind-worm." The whole skin is shiny,
  metallic, quite smooth, brown above, blackish below. But the coloration is subject to much
  individual variation. Old specimens are sometimes adorned with blue specks. The very young are
  exquisitely beautiful, the upper surface being silvery white, with a median and two more lateral
  lines of deep black; the under parts are black. The iris is yellowish red. Very large specimens
  measure more than one <span class="pagenum" id="page540"><span
  class="smaller">{540}</span></span>foot in length, more than half of which belongs to the tail.
  One in the British Museum is 425 mm. = 17 inches long.</p>

  <p>The Slow-worm is viviparous, <i>i.e.</i> the young are fully developed, and burst the
  transparent, soft, yellowish eggs immediately after these are laid. This takes place in the months
  of August or September, about one dozen making a litter. The little creatures are at first about
  one inch and a half long, and as thin as an ordinary match. They eat the smallest of spiders and
  delicate insects; later on earth-worms, which they bite into and then suck out before devouring
  them. When six weeks old and well fed they are about 3 inches long, but it is at least four or
  five years before they are mature. The little ones carefully avoid the hot sunshine, and the
  adults are likewise rather partial to the shade, although strictly diurnal. Their chief food
  consists of earth-worms and slugs. For the night they retire under moss, leaves, stones, or into
  the ground. In the autumn the Slow-worms dig passages or burrows, which often serve as the
  winter-quarters of many specimens, as if there were no other place available, or rather as if the
  spot selected were by far the best with regard to safety, dryness, and warmth.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Helodermatidae.</b>&ndash;Pleurodont, <i>poisonous</i> lizards of North America. The
  teeth are fang-like, recurved, with slightly swollen bases, rather loosely attached to the inner
  edge of the jaws. Each tooth has a groove on its anterior and posterior surface, and a series of
  labial glands which secrete the poison open near the bases of the teeth of the lower jaw. The
  skull has strong postorbital but no postfronto-squamosal arches. The pre- and post-frontals are in
  contact, separating the frontal from the orbit; the premaxillaries are fused into one; the nasals
  and frontals remain separate. The limbs are short, but strong and well developed. The tongue is
  villose, with an anterior smooth portion, which is bifid and protractile, resembling the tongue of
  the Anguidae and of <i>Aniella</i>. The skin of the upper surface is granular, with many irregular
  bony tubercles, which give it an ugly warty look. The under parts are covered with flat scales.<a
  id="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Heloderma</i>, the only genus, with <i>H. horridum</i> in Mexico and <i>H. suspectum</i> in
  New Mexico and Arizona, reaches about 2 feet <span class="pagenum" id="page541"><span
  class="smaller">{541}</span></span>in length. The animal, stout, depressed, thick-tailed, looks
  rather repulsive when it squats down in its usual lethargic way. The whole skin is blackish brown
  and yellow or orange, these two "warning" colours being distributed unevenly, except on the thick,
  peculiarly-shaped tail, where they are arranged in alternate rings. The specific differences are
  rather imaginary. The New Mexican form is supposed to be more orange and yellow than black, with a
  somewhat smoother skin and with shorter toes and tail.</p>

  <p>The "Gila Monster" inhabits dry localities, spends most of the daytime in concealment between
  the roots of trees, and crawls about in the evening in search of worms, centipedes, frogs, and the
  eggs of large lizards. Frogs are probably paralysed or killed by the bite which, although not so
  dangerous as that of poisonous snakes, is effective enough to produce severe symptoms even on man,
  and a few cases of death of people who had been bitten are on record. In captivity they are very
  partial to eggs, which they break and then lap up. During the dry and hot season they
  aestivate.</p>

  sciagraph, has come to the conclusion "that the affinity of <i>Lanthanotus</i> to the
  Helodermatidae is fully confirmed." The teeth of <i>Lanthanotus</i> show, however, no traces of
  grooves; poison-glands are probably absent, and there are no osteoderms. The skin is covered with
  wart-like tubercles, each with a horny, peeled scale. The eyes are very small, the ears are
  concealed. The general colour is reddish brown above, yellowish, with brownish bands, below. Total

  large and pointed, dilated at the base. The premaxilla is unpaired and dorsally extends backwards
  to the likewise unpaired nasal. There is a pair of small supra-orbital bones, easily lost during
  maceration. The orbit is open behind, the jugal being short and not meeting the postfrontal; the
  postorbital forms a slender arch with the supratemporal. The vomers are long and diverge

  <p><i>Varanus.</i>&ndash;The name of "Monitor" bestowed upon these creatures has a curious origin,
  owing to a ridiculous etymological mistake. The Arabic term for Lizard is "Ouaran"; this has been
  wrongly taken to mean warning lizard, hence the Latin <i>Monitor</i>, one of the many synonyms of
  this genus, e.g. <i>Hydrosaurus</i> and <i>Psammosaurus</i>. Many of the "Monitors" are
  semi-aquatic, others inhabit dry, sandy districts, while others are at home in well-wooded
  localities. They are all rapacious, taking whatever animals they can master according to their
  size, which in some species amounts to 6 or 7 feet.</p>

  <p><i>V. niloticus</i> inhabits the whole of Africa, except the north-western part. It reaches a
  length of more than 5 feet. The colour of the adult is brownish or greenish grey above, with
  darker reticulations and yellowish ocellated spots on the back and limbs. The under parts are
  yellowish with blackish cross-bands. The ground-colour of the young is black above with yellow
  lines on the head and neck, and with yellow spots on the back and limbs; the tail has black and
  yellow bars.</p>

  <p><i>V. salvator</i> ranges from Nepal to Ceylon, Cape York, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page544"><span class="smaller">{544}</span></span>Southern China, inclusive of the Malay
  Islands and the Philippines. This is the largest species, specimens of 7 feet in length being on
  record. The general colour is dark brown or blackish above, with yellow spots or ocelli. The snout
  and chin have transverse black lines on a lighter ground. A black band, bordered with yellow,
  extends from the eye along the side of the neck. The under parts are yellow.</p>

  <p>Mr. Annandale has favoured me with the following observations:&ndash;"<i>Varanus salvator</i>
  is common in Lower Siam, where it is equally at home on land, in water, and among the branches of
  trees. The eggs are laid in hollow tree-trunks. When in the water the lizard swims beneath the
  surface, the legs being closely applied to the sides, and the tail functioning both as oar and as
  rudder. Their food is very varied. In the states of Patalung and Singora, in which the Siamese
  practise a form of tree-burial, these great lizards are accused, probably with justice, of eating
  the flesh of the corpses in the a&euml;rial coffins. I have disturbed a large Monitor devouring the
  body of one of its own species, which had evidently been dead for some days. Another, which was
  chased by some men, dropped from its mouth a small flying squirrel (<i>Sciuropterus</i>); a third,
  which I dissected, had lately swallowed a small tortoise, the hard shell of which had been broken
  into innumerable fragments. The stomachs of several others contained nothing but dung-beetles, for
  which Varanus may often be seen hunting, turning over the dung of elephants and buffaloes with its
  fore-feet. The Malay name of these lizards is Biawak."</p>

  <p>According to Mason and Theobald<a id="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> all the
  Varanidae and their eggs are highly esteemed for food, and are sought for in hollow trees with the
  aid of dogs. If not wanted at once, the wretched creature has its fore-feet bent over its back, a
  few of its toes are broken and the sinews drawn out and tied into a knot, rendering the animal
  helpless. The Karens, who are extravagantly fond of the flesh, steal up the tree with a noose at
  the end of a bamboo, and often noose them while leaping for the water, or catch them in a boat
  which is brought under the tree. The head, the natives say, is venomous, and they discard it
  altogether, but the flesh of the other parts, which smells most odiously, is deemed preferable to
  that of fowls.</p>

  <p>Sir J. G. Tennent<a id="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> gives the following
  account of <i>V. salvator</i>:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"The 'Kabara-goya' of the Singhalese is partial to marshy ground, and when disturbed upon land
  will take refuge in the nearest water. From the somewhat eruptive appearance of the yellow
  blotches on its scales, a closely allied species, similarly spotted, obtained the name of
  <i>Monitor exanthematicus</i>, and it is curious that the native appellation of this one,
  <i>Kabara</i>, is suggestive of the same idea. The Singhalese, on a strictly homoeopathic
  principle, believe that its fat, externally applied, is a cure for cutaneous disorders, but that
  taken inwardly it is poisonous. The skilfulness of the Singhalese in their preparation of poisons
  and their addiction to using them are unfortunately notorious traits in the character of the rural
  population. Amongst these preparations the one which above all others excites the utmost dread,
  from the number of murders attributed to its agency, is the potent <i>kabara-tel</i>, a term which
  Europeans sometimes corrupt into <i>cobra-tel</i>, implying that the venom is obtained from the
  hooded-snake; whereas it professes to be extracted from the Kabara-goya.</p>

  <p>"In the preparation of this mysterious compound, the unfortunate Kabara-goya is forced to take
  a painfully prominent part. The receipt, as written down by a Kandyan, was sent to me from
  Kornegalle by Mr. Morris, the civil officer of that district; and in dramatic arrangement it far
  outdoes the cauldron of Macbeth's witches. The ingredients are extracted from venomous snakes by
  making incisions in the head of these reptiles and suspending them over a basin to collect the
  poison as it flows. To this, arsenic and other drugs are added, and the whole is boiled in a human
  skull, with the aid of three Kabara-goyas, which are tied on three sides of the fire, with their
  heads directed towards it, and tormented by whips to make them hiss so that the fire may blaze.
  The froth from their lips is then added to the boiling mixture, and so soon as an oily scum rises
  to the surface, the kabara-tel is complete. Before commencing the operation of preparing the
  poison, a cock has to be sacrificed to the demons.</p>

  <p>"This ugly lizard is itself regarded with such aversion by the Singhalese that if one enter a
  house or walk over the roof, it is regarded as an omen of ill-fortune, sickness, or death; and in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page546"><span class="smaller">{546}</span></span>order to avert the
  evil, a priest is employed to go through a rhythmical incantation."</p>

  <p>Captain Robinson, renowned as a hunter of tigers on foot in the old days of muzzle-loading
  rifles, has told me the following unique use to which these large lizards are put by ingenious
  thieves in India. In order to be able to get over a wall too high for climbing without assistance,
  the thief provides himself with a strong lizard, ties a rope round its waist and lets the animal
  go, when it at once scales the mud wall by its strong and sharp claws, and jumps down on the other
  side. The weight of the lizard, which, moreover, holds vigorously on to the ground, and the
  friction of the rope on the top of the wall, are sufficient to help the man over!</p>

  <p>It is a sight, never failing in its attraction to the visitors of the Zoological Gardens in
  London, to see one of the big Monitors fed with an egg. The lizard knows the treat well that is in
  store for it. It raises itself up high in expectation, then examines the egg with the long tongue,
  takes it up gingerly and swallows it entire, crushing it by the contraction of the muscles of its
  gullet. On one occasion it was given a rotten egg which burst in its mouth, and the lizard refused
  for a long time to take another.</p>

  <p><i>V. gouldi</i> is common in Australia and in New Guinea. It reaches a length of about 4 feet.
  Its colour is brown above <span class="pagenum" id="page547"><span
  class="smaller">{547}</span></span>with yellow spots on the back and limbs, and with yellow rings
  on the tail. Two yellow streaks separated by a black band extend from the temples along the side
  of the neck. The under parts are yellowish, sometimes with black spots.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Xantusiidae.</b>&ndash;Three Californian, or West-Indian genera, with less than
  half-a-dozen species. <i>Pleurodont with a short tongue and with the supratemporal fossa roofed
  over by bone.</i> The tongue is scarcely extensible, with oblique overlapping folds which converge
  towards the median line, and with scale-like imbricate papillae towards the tip. The skull
  possesses complete postorbital and postfronto-squamosal arches, the latter meeting the parietals
  and roofing over the supratemporal fossa. The palatines are in contact with each other, and there
  are no infra-orbital fossae. There are no osteoderms; the body is covered above with small
  granular scales, below with larger scales. The eyes are devoid of movable lids. The tympanum is
  exposed. Femoral pores are present. Limbs and tail well developed. <i>Xantusia</i> and
  <i>Lepidophyma</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Tejidae.</b>&ndash;American Lizards with a long and bifid tongue. The greater
  portion of the tongue is covered with scale-like papillae; the anterior forked and pointed ends
  are smooth. The teeth are solid and implanted almost upon the edge of the jaw, being therefore
  intermediate between the acrodont and pleurodont condition. The shape of the posterior teeth shows
  several modifications; they are conical or tricuspid, or molar-like in the adult Tejus; in
  <i>Dracaena</i> they are transformed into large, oval crushers. The palatines are in contact
  anteriorly. The infra-orbital fossae are surrounded by the palatine, pterygoid, and ectopterygoid
  bones, the maxillary being excluded from the fossa, as in <i>Varanus</i> (see Fig. 138, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page542">542</a></span>). The skull has no supra-temporal arch.
  Osteoderms are absent; the body is covered with small scales, or the skin is simply granular
  above; the under surface is covered with larger scales, generally arranged in transverse rows.</p>

  <p>This large family, which comprises nearly forty genera with more than a hundred species,
  exhibits great diversity of form. Some are inhabitants of forests and are arboreal, while others
  are strictly terrestrial, preferring hot and sandy plains, or they dwell below the surface and are
  transformed into almost limbless and blind-worm-shaped creatures. The range of the family extends
  over the whole of the South American continent, over the West <span class="pagenum"
  id="page548"><span class="smaller">{548}</span></span>Indian Islands, and through Central America
  into the warmer parts of the United States.</p>

  <p><i>Tupinambis</i> ("Teju").&ndash;The skin of the back is smooth, covered with small scales;
  with large scales on the top of the head. The skin on the neck is generally thrown into two
  irregular transverse folds. The long and narrow tongue is capable of being telescoped into a
  sheath at its base. The lateral teeth are compressed and tricuspid in the young, but the later
  generations of teeth have obtuse crowns in the adult. <i>T. teguixin</i> is the largest member of
  the whole family; it reaches a length of a yard, most of which, however, belongs to the tail. The
  general colour is bluish black, with pale or whitish-yellow spots on the back, flanks, and tail,
  combining into more or less transversely arranged bands. The limbs are black, with many and tiny
  yellow dots. The ground-colour of the under parts is reddish yellow, with irregular black bars.
  This species inhabits the greater part of South America, east of the Andes, from Uruguay to the
  West Indies. <i>T. nigropunctatus</i> is confined to the Continent, and lacks the dark cross-bands
  on the belly, which is uniformly yellowish or speckled with black.</p>

  <p>The "Tejus" frequent forests and plantations, and are carnivorous. Their strength and swiftness
  enable them to catch all kinds of animals, from insects and worms to frogs, snakes, mice, and
  birds. As they take chickens and eggs from the farms they are considered noxious, and they are
  frequently hunted down with dogs for the sake of their flesh, which is regarded as good to eat.
  They defend themselves with lashing strokes of their long tail and with their powerful jaws. They
  retire into burrows, and they deposit their hard-shelled eggs in the ground. In captivity they can
  easily be kept on meat.</p>

  <p><i>Dracaena guianensis</i> of the Guianas and the basin of the Amazon has the lateral teeth
  transformed into regular large molars, with broad and rounded crowns. The tail is strongly
  compressed, with a double, denticulated keel. It seems to be semi-aquatic, and, to judge from the
  teeth, herbivorous.</p>

  <p><i>Ameiva</i> and <i>Cnemidophorus</i>, with many species chiefly in tropical America, have
  laterally compressed bi- or tri-cuspid teeth. The skin forms a double fold on the neck, and is
  covered on the upper surface of the body with very small scales; those on the ventral surface are
  large, and arranged in regular rows. Most of the species are small, under one foot in length, and
  are extremely pretty, very active, timid, and mainly insectivorous.</p>

  <p><i>C. sexlineatus</i> is one of the few species of <i>Cnemidophorus</i> which inhabits the
  southern half of North America. Like all its relations it has the appearance of an ordinary lizard
  (<i>Lacerta</i>). The head is dark brown. A purple or brownish band extends over the back and
  tail, bordered on either side with three golden-yellow longitudinal lines. The flanks are brown,
  the under parts bluish white. The iris is golden, and the inner margins of the lids are bordered
  with a narrow band of bright yellow. This species is a very fast runner, and frequents dry and
  sandy places. Its total length amounts to about 10 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Lacertidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Pleurodont Old-World Lizards, without osteoderms on the
  body, and with the supratemporal regions roofed over by osteoderms.</i></p>

  <p>The limbs are always well developed, and have five fingers and five toes, always provided with
  sharp claws. The skin covering the head forms large shields, mixed with small scales; most of
  which, especially the shields, contain dermal ossifications. These frequently fuse with the
  underlying bones of the top of the skull.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The latter is always well marked off from the neck. The postorbital arch is complete. The
  temporal region is completely roofed over by bones dorsally, chiefly owing to the size of the
  postfrontal (Fig. 142, <i>pt.f<sub>2</sub></i>) which fills the space between the parietal and the
  squamoso-postorbital bridge, thus abolishing the supra-temporal fossa. The squamosal is very
  small, placed <span class="pagenum" id="page551"><span class="smaller">{551}</span></span>between
  the postfrontal (<i>pt.f<sub>2</sub></i>), the lateral occipital and the supratemporal. The large
  jugal and the quadrate are not connected with each other. The columella cranii is well developed.
  The infra-orbital fossae are surrounded by the palatines, pterygoids, ectopterygoids, and
  maxillaries. The palatines and pterygoids remain separated in the middle line. The pterygoids
  frequently carry little teeth. The other teeth are typically pleurodont, hollow, slightly curved,
  and bi- or tri-cuspid.</p>

  <p>The skin covering the body, the legs, and the tail is devoid of osteoderms. The scales on the
  dorsal surface vary much in size, from large, strongly keeled scales to tiny granulations. Those
  of the ventral surface are large, broader than long, and are frequently arranged in regular
  transverse and longitudinal rows. The tail, generally long and pointed, is very brittle. All the
  sense-organs are well developed. The tympanum is exposed. The tongue is deeply bifurcated, narrow,
  flat, and covered with scale-like papillae.</p>

  <p>Various Lacertidae, especially some of those genera which live and dig in the sand, have a
  transparent disc in the middle of the lower eyelid, so that they can see while the eye itself is
  protected. This is for instance the case in some specimens of the Indian and African
  <i>Eremias</i>. In the Indian genus <i>Cabrita</i> the transparent disc is very large, and in
  <i>Ophiops</i>, which inhabits sandy stretches from North Africa to India, the lower eyelid is
  fused with the rim of the much-reduced upper lid, and forms a large transparent window.</p>

  <p>The Lacertidae or True Lizards comprise nearly twenty genera, with about one hundred species,
  and are typical of the Old World, being found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, but not in Madagascar
  nor in the Australian region. They are most abundant in Africa. Their northern limit coincides
  fairly closely with the limit of the permanently frozen under-ground. This is indicated in the map
  (Fig. 143) by the dotted line. All the Lacertidae live upon animal food, chiefly insects, and
  after them worms and snails; but the larger lizards take what they can master, frequently other
  lizards, and even younger members of their own kind. Many of them love sugar, which they lick, and
  all require water. They are all terrestrial, preferring, according to their kind, such localities
  as yield them their particular food.</p>

  <p>Sunshine and warmth make a marvellous change in the same individual, which on dull, rainy, or
  cold days lies in its hole, or shows only sluggish movements. Their sense of locality is great, or
  rather each individual inhabits one place, of which it knows every nook and corner, cranny, tree,
  and bush. It has its favourite hole to sleep in, a stone, the branch of a tree, or a wall to bask
  upon, and when disturbed or chased it makes with unerring swiftness for a safe spot to retire
  into. The same lizard, when once driven away from its own locality, seems to lose all its presence
  of mind, flounders about, and is comparatively easily caught. Most lizards are extremely curious,
  although shy, and this state of their mind can be made use of by those who want to catch them
  without injury, and above all without getting the animal minus the brittle tail. This safe way of
  catching lizards consists in taking a thin rod with a running noose of thread at the end, in
  drawing the latter over the lizard's head, and then raising it. The little creature does not mind
  the rod in the least; on the contrary, it watches it carefully, and often makes for the thread.
  The boys in Southern Italy have improved upon and simplified this mode of catching lizards by
  bending the end of a wisp of grass into a noose, and covering the latter over with a thin film of
  saliva. The shiny film, like a soap-bubble, is sure to excite the curiosity of the creature. The
  late Professor Eimer<a id="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> refers to this practice
  <span class="pagenum" id="page553"><span class="smaller">{553}</span></span>as carried out by the
  children of two thousand years ago, and he sagaciously explains that the beautiful statue of the
  so-called Apollo Sauroctonos represents a boy who is in the act of noosing the little lizard on
  the tree.</p>

  <p><i>Lacerta.</i>&ndash;A row of enlarged scales forms a distinct collar across the ventral half
  of the neck, in front of the chest. The scales on the back are much smaller than those on the
  tail, which is long, round, and pointed. The digits have smooth, tubercular lamellae on the under
  surface. Femoral pores are well marked. This genus, with about twenty species, ranges through
  Europe, Northern and Western Asia, and Africa north of the Equator.</p>

  <p><i>L. vivipara</i>, the Common English Lizard, has a very wide range, through Northern and
  Central Europe and Siberia to the Amoor country and the Island of Saghalien. It occurs throughout
  Great Britain, even in Ireland, where it is the only species of reptile, occurring, for instance,
  in the County of Meath and in the south-eastern counties, <i>e.g.</i> Waterford. It does not occur
  south of the Pyrenees or south of the Alps. The supra-ocular and the supraciliary scales are in
  contact with each other, not being separated by a series of little granules. Normally there is a
  single postnasal and a single anterior loreal shield. The ventral scales are arranged in six or
  eight longitudinal series, of which the second series on each side from the median ventral line is
  the largest. The coloration of this species is subject to much variation. The general colour of
  the adult is brown or reddish above, with small darker and lighter spots; many specimens have a
  blackish vertebral streak and a dark lateral band edged with yellow. The under parts are orange to
  red in the male, with conspicuous black spots; yellow or pale orange in the female, either without
  or with scanty black spots. The newly-born specimens are almost black. The males are slightly
  smaller than the females; males of a total length of 6 inches, and females 7 inches long, may be
  considered rather large specimens.</p>

  <p>This lizard is, as the specific name implies, viviparous, i.e. the six to twelve young burst
  the eggs immediately after they have been laid; sometimes the mother has to retard the laying, in
  which case the young are born free. The female does not make a nest, but simply deposits her
  offspring on the ground and leaves the young to their fate. For the first few days the little
  ones, which scarcely measure three-quarters of an inch in <span class="pagenum" id="page554"><span
  class="smaller">{554}</span></span>length, remain almost motionless between leaves or in cracks of
  the ground, and they do not take any food. They grow, however, quickly, living upon the remains of
  the yolk which has slipped into their body. Their first food consists of Aphides and similar tiny
  insects.</p>

  <p>The Common Lizard prefers moist localities and is very hardy. It extends northwards to
  Archangel, and in the Alps it ascends to nearly 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. However,
  on the approach of the cold season, in the month of October, it withdraws into its winter
  quarters, frequently in company with many of its own kind.</p>

  <p><i>L. agilis</i>, the Sand-Lizard, has nearly the same wide range as <i>L. vivipara</i>, except
  that it does not go so far north and does not extend eastwards beyond Central Siberia. It is
  absent in Ireland and Scotland, while in England it is restricted to the southern half.</p>

  <p>The characters which distinguish the Sand-Lizard from <i>L. vivipara</i> are few, although the
  majority of the specimens of either kind are very distinct in their coloration, and <i>L.
  agilis</i> is strictly oviparous, depositing its eggs in the ground, under leaves, in heaps of
  weeds and similar places. The Sand-Lizard has usually a single postnasal and two superposed
  anterior loreals, the three shields forming a triangle. The temples are covered with flat scales,
  two or three of which are enlarged and in contact with the parietals, but there is no tympanic
  scale.</p>

  <p>The coloration is subject to much variation, local as well as individual. As a rule the
  Sand-Lizard gives the impression of being striped longitudinally, the striation being caused by
  rows of dark and white spots and patches along the sides of the back, flanks, and tail. In the
  male a more or less pronounced green, in the female brown and grey are the prevailing
  ground-colours. A typically coloured male during the breeding season is grass-green on the sides
  and suffused with green on the yellow under parts; the sides are dotted with black, with whitish
  eye-spots. The under parts are spotted with black. The adult female is brown or grey above, with
  large dark brown, white-centred spots, which are arranged in three rows on each side. The under
  parts are cream-coloured, with or without black specks. The young are grey-brown above with white,
  black-edged spots; the under parts are whitish. Total length of the adult up to 8 inches. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page555"><span class="smaller">{555}</span></span>The male is a little smaller
  than the female but has a relatively longer tail, a little less than half the total length.</p>

  <p>The Sand-Lizard is easily kept in captivity, and lives for years if allowed a variety of food
  and proper places to hibernate in. It pairs in the spring, in England in May or June; the white,
  parchment-like eggs, numbering five to eight, are hatched in the following July or August.</p>

  <p><i>L. viridis</i>, the Green Lizard, inhabits Southern and Middle Europe and South-Western
  Asia. The general colour of this beautiful lizard is emerald-green above, changing into greenish
  yellow on the flanks and into yellow on the belly. The throat, especially in the males during the
  breeding season, is blue. The upper parts are frequently speckled with black. The young are brown
  or green above with one or two yellowish lateral stripes, which persist in some adult females.
  There are usually two superposed postnasal shields. The semilunar collar on the neck is well
  pronounced, and there is usually a distinct gular fold. The tail is often very long, especially in
  the males, sometimes nearly three-quarters of the total length, which in very large males reaches
  16 or 17 inches. The females do not quite reach this length.</p>

  <p>The Green or Emerald-Lizard prefers rocky localities, from the sea-level, as for instance in
  Jersey, up to a height of several thousand feet. It is extremely swift and can climb trees, which
  it sometimes resorts to when chased. When hard pressed it takes tremendous leaps down to the
  ground, marvellously enough without injury to body or tail, which latter is otherwise very
  brittle. They pair in the spring or early summer after much fighting between the males; the eggs,
  to the number of about ten, are whitish and are deposited a month later. The young are hatched
  after another four weeks.</p>

  <p>This beautiful lizard does not keep well in captivity, although it becomes very tame; it eats
  meal-worms, snails, earth-worms, and insects, especially butterflies, but it sickens after the
  first winter even if it has been allowed to hibernate.</p>

  <p>In Portugal and Spain <i>L. viridis</i> is represented by a slightly different kind, <i>L.
  schreiberi</i>, the chief interest of which lies in the fact that it approaches <i>L. ocellata</i>
  in several respects. The occipital shield is large and is usually broader than the interparietal.
  The dorsal scales are smaller, and there are eight <span class="pagenum" id="page556"><span
  class="smaller">{556}</span></span>well-developed rows of ventral scales. Instead of being
  uniformly green, the upper parts are usually spotted and vermiculated with black; sometimes,
  especially in the females, the black spots have a white ocellus in the centre. The under parts are
  yellowish, with or without black spots. The throat is blue. The young look very different. They
  are olive-brown above with large yellow, or bluish-white, black-edged ocelli on the side of the
  head and body.</p>

  <p>Other forms, perhaps of sub-specific rank, approaching <i>L. ocellata</i>, occur in the Balkan
  Peninsula, where, for instance in Dalmatia, the typical <i>L. viridis</i> attains its most
  beautiful development.</p>

  dark olive above, with black or yellowish dots, which are sometimes combined into a kind of
  network pattern. The under parts are uniformly greenish yellow. The sides of the body are adorned
  with about two dozen blue, black-edged spots or "eyes." The intensity of the blue and the depth of
  the green ground-colour vary much according to sex, time of the year, and state of health. Males
  during the breeding season are most beautiful and brilliant. The occipital shield is broad; there
  are two superposed nasal but no tympanic shields. The supraoculars are separated from the
  supraciliaries by a series of granules. The collar is well marked, but not the gular fold. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page557"><span class="smaller">{557}</span></span>The dorsal scales are minute
  and granular; the ventral shields are arranged in eight or ten longitudinal rows.</p>

  <p>The "Eyed Lizard" reaches a considerable size, especially the males, which develop a very
  strong and thick head, and are much more robust and powerful than the more slender females. Old
  males reach a length of 2 feet, two-thirds of which length belong to the tail; but the latter
  varies much, even if it has never been broken and renewed.</p>

  <p>The Eyed Lizard keeps extremely well in captivity, and in this respect is unlike the Green
  Lizard. A case has been recorded of its living thirteen years. This species is very intelligent.
  Although at first ferociously wild and biting furiously, these lizards soon become tame and take
  food regularly. One of my own, a half-grown male from Northern Spain, about one foot in length,
  made its home in a little niche of the greenhouse-wall, whence it emerged regularly to take the
  offered food from my hand. It soon knew the whole place thoroughly, making use of the creepers
  whilst scaling up to its retreat, jumping over certain gaps, descending to the ground at certain
  spots, basking on certain stones, invariably in the same methodical way. In the month of October
  it retires into the ground on the coolest side of the greenhouse, and although the latter is well
  warmed, the lizard remains invisible until the next February or March, when on some fine day it is
  rediscovered basking upon exactly the same stone where it had been seen five months before. The
  only drawback in connexion with keeping this kind of lizard in company with other creatures is
  their voraciousness; since large, fully adult specimens attack and eat any other small lizard,
  slow-worm, or snake they can find. They also take mice. The eggs are often deposited in hollow
  trees.</p>

  <p><i>L. muralis</i>, the Wall-Lizard, is very common in Southern Europe, Asia Minor, and Northern
  Africa. Northward it extends into Belgium and into South Germany. In the Iberian Peninsula it
  ascends up to 5000 or 6000 feet above the level of the sea. This graceful little creature, with an
  average length of 6 to 8 inches, is easily recognised by the series of granules between the
  supraocular and supraciliary scales and usually by having only six rows of ventral scales. The
  great variety in coloration has given rise to the establishment of many races, varieties, and
  sub-species. In the typical forms the upper parts are brown or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page558"><span class="smaller">{558}</span></span>greyish, with blackish spots or streaks,
  sometimes with a bronzy greenish sheen. The under parts are white, yellow, pink, or red, either
  uniform or, especially in the males, with large black spots. The lateral rows of ventral shields
  are frequently blue. The colour-varieties are almost endless. One of the most noteworthy is that
  described as var. <i>coerulea</i> by Eimer; this, confined to the Faraglione Rocks near C&aacute;pri, is
  blackish above, like the rock, and sapphire-blue below. Similarly coloured specimens, var.
  <i>lilfordi</i>, occur on some of the rocky islets of the Balearic Isles.</p>

  <p>The Wall-Lizard deserves its name, since in the Mediterranean countries there is scarcely a
  wall on which these active lizards do not bask or run up and down, often head downwards, in search
  of insects. They are oviparous. The hibernation is short and not very deep, since these lizards
  can sometimes be seen basking on sunny winter days before their regular appearance in the early
  spring.</p>

  <p><i>Psammodromus</i>, with a few species in South-Western Europe, notably in the Iberian
  Peninsula and in North-Western Africa, has no distinct semilunar collar, but has a short fold in
  front of each arm. The back is covered with large, rhombic, strongly keeled and imbricating
  scales. The lateral scales pass gradually into the ventrals, which are smooth and arranged in six
  longitudinal rows.</p>

  <p><i>P. hispanicus</i> is bronzy brown above, with small black and white specks, and with one or
  two longitudinal streaks on each side. The under parts are white. Total length about 5 inches.
  Although also found inland, this species prefers sandy dunes, studded with prickly and scanty
  vegetation. It runs very fast and digs itself rapidly into the sand when pursued. When caught it
  either utters a faint cry like "tsi-tsi," or it feigns death. The pairing takes place in June;
  half-a-dozen eggs are laid about eighteen days later, deeply imbedded in the warm sand, and they
  are hatched in eight weeks. The eggs are said to grow<a id="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> after they have been laid from 13 by 7 mm. to 17-20 by 10-11
  mm. The newly hatched little creatures measure about 2 inches in length, more than half of which
  belongs to the tail.</p>

  <p><i>P.</i> (<i>Tropidosaura</i>) <i>algirus</i> has the same range as <i>P. hispanicus</i>, but
  grows to 10 inches in length, and is much more <span class="pagenum" id="page559"><span
  class="smaller">{559}</span></span>beautifully coloured. The upper parts are bronzy brown with one
  or two golden, dark-edged, lateral streaks; the under parts are whitish; the male has one or more
  blue-eyed spots above each shoulder.</p>

  <p><i>Acanthodactylus</i> is distinguished by the laterally fringed digits. This genus ranges
  throughout Northern Africa to the Punjab. One species, <i>A. vulgaris</i>, extends into Spain and
  Portugal. The dorsal scales are small and almost smooth, but those on the tail are strongly
  keeled; the ventrals are much broader than long, and are arranged in eight to ten rows. The
  fringes on the digits are but feebly developed in the shape of lateral denticulations. The adults
  are grey-brown with faint longitudinal stripes, and with more conspicuous black and pale spots; in
  the breeding season larger blue-eyed spots appear on the sides near the limbs. The tail is often
  pink, especially on the under surface. Total length about 7 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 12. Gerrhosauridae.</b>&ndash;Pleurodont African Lacertidae with osteoderms on the head
  and body.</p>

  <p>This family is intermediate between the Lacertidae and the Scincidae. The tongue is constructed
  like that of the Lacertidae, but is only feebly nicked anteriorly. Dermal ossifications roof over
  the temporal region, and femoral pores are present. On the other hand, the osteoderms, which cover
  the whole body, are in their structure and arrangement typically Scincoid. The tail is long and
  fragile. A lateral fold is usually present. The limbs are sometimes reduced to useless stumps. The
  few genera and species of this family are strictly confined to the African sub-region, being found
  in the whole of Africa south of the Sahara, and in Madagascar.</p>

  <p><i>Gerrhosaurus</i>, with a strongly developed lateral fold and complete limbs, occurs in
  Africa. <i>G. flavigularis</i>, of South Africa, has a total length about one foot.</p>

  <p><i>Tetradactylus</i>, of South Africa, has also a strong lateral fold, but the limbs are either
  very short and pentadactyle (<i>T. seps</i>), or tetradactyle, or they are minute pointed stumps,
  as in <i>T. africanus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Scincidae.</b>&ndash;Pleurodont lizards with strongly developed osteoderms on head
  and body, with very feebly nicked, scaly tongue, with complete cranial arches, and with separated
  premaxillaries.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page560"><span class="smaller">{560}</span></span></div>

  <p>The temporal region is covered over, as in the Lacertidae, with strongly developed, bony,
  dermal ossifications. Similar osteoderms underlie the scales which cover the body and tail. The
  tongue is relatively short, not forked behind, and but very feebly nicked at the tip; it is
  covered with scale-like papillae. Femoral pores are absent.</p>

  <p>All the Skinks prefer dry, sandy ground, in which they not only burrow, but move quickly about,
  either for protection or in search of their animal food. In connexion with this sand-loving and at
  least temporary subterranean life stands the frequent reduction of the limbs. Every stage from the
  fully developed and functional pentadactyle limb to complete absence of limbs is represented.
  There are species within the same genus with five, four, three, or two fingers or toes. There are
  Skinks without fore-limbs, but with vestigial hind-limbs, and <i>vice versa</i>. The interesting
  point is that these reductions do not indicate relationship within the family, but have happened
  independently. They are impressive illustrations of convergent retrogressive evolution.</p>

  <p><i>Ablepharus</i>, widely distributed in the Old World, has the lower eyelid transformed into a
  transparent cover, which is fused with the rim of the reduced upper lid, exactly as in the
  Lacertine genus <i>Ophiops</i>.</p>

  <p>All the Scincidae seem to be viviparous, some of them, e.g. <i>Trachysaurus</i>, in the strict
  sense of the word, since the hard or parchment-like egg-shell has been dispensed with.</p>

  <p>The family contains about four hundred species, which have been arranged in nearly thirty
  genera, many of them on fanciful grounds. The family is cosmopolitan, but reaches its greatest
  diversity in numbers and forms in the tropical parts of the Old World, especially in the
  Australian region, inclusive of the islands of the Pacific. America, notably South America, has
  the smallest number.</p>

  <p><i>Trachysaurus</i>, with one species, <i>T. rugosus</i>, inhabits the whole of the Australian
  continent. It is easily recognised by the large and rough scales, and the short and broad
  stump-like tail. It is dark brown above with yellowish irregular markings; the under parts are
  yellowish, marked with brown. Embryos of this species have yellow transverse bands on the back,
  but these often fade away before birth. The creature is strictly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page561"><span class="smaller">{561}</span></span>viviparous, the egg-membrane being very
  thin, and the two or three embryos are ripened in uterus-like dilatations of the oviducts. The
  period of gestation is about three months, and the birth takes place, in South Australia, about
  April. According to Fischer<a id="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> this species, which
  is often in the market, is easily kept. It requires warmth, sand and stones for basking, and
  water, in which it soaks itself preparatory to the shedding of the skin, which takes place
  half-a-dozen times in the year, and is a slow process, requiring eight to ten days. The food
  consists chiefly of worms, lizards, and snakes, but meat, cabbage, and lettuce are also taken. The
  total length is about one foot.</p>

  <p><i>Cyclodus</i> s. <i>Tiliqua</i>, of Australia, Tasmania, and the Malay Islands, has stout
  lateral teeth with spherical crowns. The imbricating, cycloid scales of the body and the rather
  short but pointed tail are quite smooth and shiny. <i>C. gigas</i>, of New Guinea and the
  Moluccas, reaches a length of nearly 2 feet. The general colour is brownish yellow, with broad,
  dark bands across the body and tail.</p>

  <p><i>Scincus</i>, of North Africa, Arabia, Persia, and Sindh, has pentadactyle limbs, with
  laterally serrated digits. The eyelids are well developed, but the ear is hidden under scaly
  flaps. <i>S. officinalis</i>, of the Sahara and of Egypt, grows to about 8 inches in length. The
  snout is peculiarly shaped, cuneiform. The eyes are very small. The scales of the body are
  perfectly smooth; the sides of the belly are somewhat angular. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page562"><span class="smaller">{562}</span></span>whole shape of the creature, the scales, and
  the digits are adapted to burrowing and moving quickly through the loose sand. The general colour
  is yellowish or brownish above, each scale with small brown and whitish spots; the under parts are
  uniform whitish. The young are quite beautiful, being uniform pale salmon-coloured above, silvery
  white below. When a little older, yellow spots appear on the flanks and grey bands across the
  back. These Skinks live in the absolutely dry reddish-yellow sand of the desert, in which they may
  almost be said to swim about, so swift and easy are their movements. They live on insects, while
  in their turn they are eaten by snakes, and above all by the <i>Varanus</i> lizards.</p>

  <p>Of <i>Mabuia</i> with about forty species, in the whole of Africa, Southern Asia, and in
  Tropical America, we mention only <i>M.</i> (<i>Euprepes</i>) <i>vittata</i>, on account of its
  partly semi-aquatic life, a very rare condition among Scincidae. This creature, about 7 inches
  long when full grown, frequents damp localities in Tunis and Algeria, where the French call it
  "Poisson de sable." It often sits on the floating leaves of <i>Nymphaea alba</i>, and dives into
  the water in order to escape. Its proper element is, however, the sand, and for the night it
  retires under stones. The general colour is olive brown with a lighter vertebral band and two
  narrow whitish lines on each side, sometimes edged with black. The under parts are yellowish or
  greenish white.</p>

  <p><i>Chalcides</i> s. <i>Seps</i> s. <i>Gongylus</i>, of the Mediterranean countries <span
  class="pagenum" id="page563"><span class="smaller">{563}</span></span>also occurs in South-Western
  Asia. The lower eyelid has a transparent disc. The body is much elongated, and is covered with
  smooth shiny scales. The limbs are very short, or reduced to mere vestiges.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. ocellatus</i>, of the Southern Mediterranean countries, occurring also in Malta and
  Sardinia, reaches about 10 inches in length. The snout is conical, the ear-opening a small slit or
  hole. The limbs have five fingers and toes. The under parts are uniform silvery white, but the
  colour of the upper parts is very variable, mostly olive brown with black spots and irregular
  cross-bars, or with dark and light spots; sometimes uniform bronzy brown with a light upper and a
  black lateral band. This Skink seems to have no fixed abode, but digs itself into the sand
  wherever it wants to hide. The skin is not shed in flakes, but, as in most Skinks, it peels off by
  a process of gradual desquamation. Fischer's specimens paired towards the end of December. The
  gestation lasted 56 days, when nine young were born, which measured about 75 mm. or 3 inches; when
  three weeks old they had increased to nearly double this length.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. lineatus</i>, of Spain and Portugal, and of the South of France, like <i>Ch.
  tridactylus</i> of Italy and North-West Africa, has only three fingers and toes. The fore-limbs
  are only about one quarter of an inch in length in large specimens of 10 inches total length; the
  hind-limbs are a little longer. The general colour is bronzy olive or brown above, in the former
  species with nine or eleven darker longitudinal streaks; uniform, and with an even number of
  streaks in the latter species. <i>Ch. bedriagae</i>, of Spain and Portugal, has mostly five
  fingers and toes, and the limbs are relatively longer in this smaller species; but it is a
  question if these and other species of this genus are not to a great extent simply individual
  variations, since the reduction of the limbs and toes seems to be a very recent feature. <i>Ch.
  guentheri</i>, of Palestine, otherwise in every respect like <i>Ch. tridactylus</i>, but reaching
  a length of more than 14 inches, has the limbs reduced to tiny conical stumps without a trace of
  separate digits.</p>

  <p>I have caught <i>Seps</i> accidentally under stones or pieces of bark in sandy districts. On
  the western coast of Galicia and Portugal, close to the sea, they frequent the gorse-bushes, on
  which they can be seen basking, provided they are approached <span class="pagenum"
  id="page564"><span class="smaller">{564}</span></span>stealthily. They disappear on the slightest
  alarm, almost swimming, as it were, with great agility through the prickly cover, and then hiding
  and wriggling through the loose sand between the roots.</p>

  <p>The following five "families" are composed of degraded forms of various descent. Most of them
  lead a burrowing, subterranean life, in adaptation to which the body has become snake-shaped or
  worm-like. The fore-limbs are entirely absent, except in <i>Chirotes</i>; the hind-limbs are
  absent, or reduced to small flaps; the girdles are reduced correspondingly. The skull is devoid of
  postorbital, postfronto-squamosal, supratemporal, and jugal arches. The quadrate bone is mostly
  immovable. The eyes and ears are concealed, except in the Pygopodidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Anelytropidae.</b>&ndash;An artificial assembly of a few degraded Scincoids. The
  worm-shaped, limbless body is devoid of osteoderms. The tongue is short, slightly nicked
  anteriorly, and covered with imbricating papillae. Columellae cranii are present. <i>Anelytropsis
  papillosus</i> in Mexico. <i>Typhlosaurus</i> and <i>Feylinia</i> in South and West Africa.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 15. Dibamidae</b>, consisting of the genus <i>Dibamus</i>, with <i>D.
  novae-guineae</i>, in New Guinea, the Moluccas, Celebes, and the Nicobar Islands. The tongue is
  arrow-shaped, undivided in front, covered with curved papillae. Columellae cranii are absent. The
  vermiform body is covered with cycloid imbricating scales without osteoderms. The limbs and even
  their arches are absent, but in the males the hind-limbs are represented by a pair of flaps. Total
  length of the animal about 6 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 16. Aniellidae.</b>&ndash;The genus <i>Aniella</i> comprises a few small worm- or
  snake-shaped species in California, which seem to be degraded forms of Anguidae. The eyes and ears
  are concealed, limbs are entirely absent, the body and tail are covered with soft, imbricating,
  more or less hexagonal scales. The tongue is villose, smooth, and bifid anteriorly. The teeth are
  relatively large, few in numbers, recurved, with short swollen bases. The skull, by reduction,
  approaches the Ophidian type; there is no columella cranii, the postorbital arch is ligamentous,
  the premaxillary is single, the nasals and frontals remain separate, the pre- and post-orbitals
  are in contact with each other, excluding the frontal from the orbit.</p>

  <p><i>A. pulchra.</i>&ndash;Silvery, the scales edged with brown; back and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page565"><span class="smaller">{565}</span></span>tail with a narrow, brown, median line.
  Total length, 7 to 8 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 17. Amphisbaenidae.</b>&ndash;Worm-shaped lizards with the soft skin forming numerous
  rings, each of which is divided into many little squares, the vestiges of scales which are
  otherwise restricted to the head. The eyes and ears are concealed. Limbs are absent except in
  <i>Chirotes</i>, which has short four-clawed fore-limbs. The pectoral arch, and still more so the
  pelvic arch, are reduced to minute vestiges. The tail is very short. The skull is small, compact,
  and strongly ossified, in adaptation to the burrowing life, and is devoid of postorbital and
  postfronto-squamosal arches and of columellae. The teeth are either acrodont or pleurodont. The
  tongue is slightly elongated, covered with scale-like papillae, and bifurcates into two long and
  narrow smooth points.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 147.</span>&ndash;Map showing the distribution of
      Amphisbaenidae.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Amphisbaenas lead an entirely subterranean, burrowing life, like earth-worms. They are
  frequently found in ants' nests or in manure-heaps. Their progression is very worm-like, their
  annulated soft skin enabling them to make almost peristaltic motions and to move backwards as well
  as forwards. They crawl in a straight line, with slight vertical waves, not, like other limbless
  lizards or snakes, by lateral undulations. The food consists of worms and small insects. About one
  dozen genera with more than sixty species are known, most of which inhabit the warmer parts of
  America, the West Indies, and Africa. Four inhabit Mediterranean countries.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page566"><span class="smaller">{566}</span></span></div>

  <p>If the tongue and the dentition be taken as indications of relationship, the Amphisbaenidae may
  perhaps be considered as degraded descendants of Iguanidae, a family which contains various
  limbless, burrowing, worm-shaped forms. But it is also possible that the Amphisbaenidae are not a
  natural group. This consideration applies with most force to the genera <i>Amphisbaena</i> and
  <i>Anops</i>, the various species of which occur in America and in Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Chirotes canaliculatus</i>, the only species of the genus, is the only Amphisbaenid which
  still possesses fore-limbs. These are short, stout, placed close behind the head, and are provided
  with four-clawed digits. This species occurs in Mexico and California, is brownish or
  flesh-coloured, and reaches a length of about 8 inches.</p>

  <p><i>Amphisbaena</i>, with nearly thirty species, in Tropical America and Africa. On account of
  the short rounded-off head and the almost equally blunt tail these creatures are called by the
  natives "cobras de dous cabezas," <i>i.e.</i> snakes with two heads, or they are known as "maes
  das formigas," <i>i.e.</i> mothers of ants, because of their predilection for taking up their
  quarters in the nests of ants or termites. The scientific name refers of course to their
  capability of moving forwards and backwards (<span title="amphis"
  class="fsn">&#x1F00;&mu;&phi;&#x03AF;&sigmaf;</span>, at both ends, and <span title="bain&ocirc;"
  class="fsn">&beta;&alpha;&#x03AF;&nu;&omega;</span>, walk).</p>

  <p><i>A. fuliginosa</i>, one of the commonest species in South America and in the West Indies, is
  chequered black and white. The skin of the body has about two hundred rings, the tail about
  thirty. Total length between one and two feet. A more or less distinct fold extends along each
  side of the body from the neck to the tail, at the level where the dorsal scales originally joined
  the ventral scales.</p>

  <p><i>Blanus</i> is the only genus of the Mediterranean province. <i>B. cinereus</i>, of Portugal,
  Spain south of the Cantabrian range, Morocco, and Algeria, reaches a length of 10 inches, but such
  large specimens are rather rare. The general colour of the living animal is pink with a brownish
  tinge and with minute grey specks. The lateral lines or folds are well marked, and a stronger
  transverse fold is placed behind the head. The body shows from one hundred and ten to one hundred
  and twenty-five rings, the tail from twenty to twenty-two; each body-ring contains about thirty
  little squares or remnants of scales. There are a few pre-anal pores.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page567"><span class="smaller">{567}</span></span></div>

  <p>I have sometimes found this species in Portugal whilst digging for earth-worms in manure-heaps
  and similar moist places, where they lead the same life as the worms except that they live upon
  them and upon insects. When kept dry they become very thin and shrunken, but when put back into
  moist soil they again become turgid and supple within a short time. Those which I have kept in
  glass jars filled with rich mould throve very well, living upon the tiny insects and worms which
  infest such compost soil; they dug long tortuous channels, in which they moved forwards and
  sometimes backwards, but they never came to the surface.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 18. Pygopodidae.</b>&ndash;Pleurodont, snake-shaped lizards, without fore-limbs, but
  with the hind-limbs appearing as a pair of scaly flaps.</p>

  <p>The shoulder-girdle is much reduced. The hind-limbs, although very small and hidden within the
  scaly, almost fin-like flaps, still possess five toes. The ischium appears externally as a small
  spur on either side of the anal cleft. The eyes are devoid of movable lids, remaining open and
  unprotected; the pupil is vertical. The ear is either concealed or exposed. The tongue is fleshy,
  slightly forked and extensible. The body is covered with roundish imbricating scales. The tail is
  very long and brittle. The few genera of this undoubtedly natural family of unknown relationship
  contain in all about ten species, restricted entirely to Australia, Tasmania, and perhaps New
  Guinea. Next to nothing is known about their habits, except that some of them eat other
  lizards.</p>

  <p><i>Pygopus lepidopus</i> is distributed over the whole of Australia. It reaches a total length
  of about 2 feet, 16 inches of which belong to the tail. General colour coppery grey above,
  sometimes with several longitudinal series of dark spots.</p>

  <p><i>Lialis burtoni</i> of nearly the same size and equally wide distribution has the hind-limbs
  reduced to extremely small, scarcely visible, narrow appendages.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Order 3. Chamaeleontes.</b>&ndash;<i>Acrodont Old-World Saurians with a laterally
  compressed body, prehensile tail, and well-developed limbs with the digits arranged in opposing,
  grasping, bundles of two and three respectively.</i></p>

  <p>The Chameleons are an essentially African family. About half of the fifty species known inhabit
  Madagascar, the others <span class="pagenum" id="page568"><span
  class="smaller">{568}</span></span>the African continent. One, the common Chameleon, is North
  African, extending into Andalucia; two others occur in South Arabia and Socotra, and only one in
  Southern India and Ceylon.</p>

  <p>This sub-order is well distinguished from all other Saurians by several, mostly unique,
  characters. The tongue is club-shaped and extremely projectile, to a length equal to that of the
  body. The head is usually described as forming a casque, with prominent crests and tubercles.
  There is no tympanum and no tympanic cavity. The parietal bones, united into one, extend backwards
  far beyond the occiput, and the tip of this projection is met by a much-elongated supratemporal
  bone, which, partly fused with the squamosal, helps to enclose a huge supratemporal fossa. The
  latter is widely open behind. The postfronto-squamosal arch and the postorbital arch are strong.
  The jugal is widely separated from the quadrate; the latter stands vertically and is not reached
  by the pterygoid. There is no columella cranii. The pre- and post-frontals often join to form a
  supra-orbital roof. The nasals are very small and are excluded from the nares, which are bordered
  entirely by the enlarged prefrontals and by the maxillaries. The premaxillaries are small and
  carry no teeth. The latter are acrodont, compressed and tricuspid, and are restricted to the
  maxillaries and mandibles.</p>

      Chameleons.</p>

  <p>The limbs are peculiar. Not only are they relatively long and very slender, but two digits are
  permanently opposed to the other three. On the hand the first three fingers form an inner bundle
  opposed to the outer, or fourth and fifth fingers. On the foot the inner bundle is formed by the
  first and second, the outer by the other toes. The shoulder-girdle is of the ordinary Saurian
  type, but there are no clavicles and no interclavicle. The costal sternum is well developed; the
  ribs posterior to those which meet the sternum are very thin and elongated: they meet and fuse
  with their fellows in the medio-ventral line. These hoops are not connected with their neighbours
  in front or behind. The tail is prehensile by being rolled downwards; it is not brittle and is
  incapable of being renewed. The skin is not covered with scales, but with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page569"><span class="smaller">{569}</span></span>granules. The eyes are very remarkable. The
  eyeballs themselves are large, but the eyelids are united into one fold with a small central
  opening. However, when the Chameleon is asleep the margins of this opening sometimes become more
  slit-like. The right and left eye can be, and are incessantly, moved separately from each other,
  and the creature squints terribly. Each eyeball, together with the pin-hole eyelid, is rolled up
  and down, backwards and forwards, independently of the other eye. This is a unique feature, but it
  also occurs in people who squint badly. The question "What, and how, do these creatures see?" is
  therefore quite idle, especially since in reptiles binocular vision does not exist at all and,
  consequently, cannot be disturbed by squinting.</p>

  <p>The tongue has attained an extraordinary development. The tongue proper (Fig. 152) is
  club-shaped, and is covered with a sticky secretion. The base or root of the tongue is very
  narrow, composed of extremely elastic fibres, and is supported by a much-elongated copular piece
  of the hyoid. The elastic part of the tongue is, so to speak, telescoped over the style-shaped
  copula, and the whole apparatus is kept in a contracted state like a spring in a tube.</p>

  <p>A pair of wide, very elastic blood-vessels and special elastic bands extend from the base into
  the thick end of the tongue. <span class="pagenum" id="page570"><span
  class="smaller">{570}</span></span>By rapidly filling the apparatus with blood, and by the action
  of certain hyoid muscles, the spring is, so to speak, released, and the momentum gained by the
  thick and heavy club-shaped tongue proper projects it far out of the mouth. The sticky end of the
  club shapes itself into an upper and a lower flap, which partly envelop the prey, and the elastic
  bands of the far-stretched stalk withdraw the whole. The detailed working of this ingenious
  shooting apparatus is not easy to follow. An ordinary full-grown Chameleon can shoot a fly at the
  distance of 7 or 8 inches. The whole performance is very quick, lasting less than one second. When
  the desired object is very near, only 2 or 3 inches off, the Chameleon has a certain difficulty in
  shooting its prey. The tongue is at first put out slowly, tentatively, the following jerk is
  feeble, and it seems as if the apparatus refuses to work unless it is allowed to shoot out with
  full force.</p>

  <p>Another remarkable and quite proverbial feature of Chameleons is their changing of colour. This
  is by no means restricted to Chameleons, which indeed are rivalled in this respect by various
  other lizards, for instance by the Indian Agamoid <i>Calotes</i> and by the American
  <i>Ameiva</i>.</p>

  <p>The microscopical structure and mechanism of the colour-changing apparatus is, in <i>Chamaeleon
  vulgaris</i>, as follows:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The epidermis is colourless, and the Malpighian layer is not particularly modified except that
  in it are imbedded some iridescent cells, with very minute wavy striation on their surface. The
  cutis contains in its leathery tissue a great number of small and closely packed cells, filled
  with strongly refractive granules, chiefly guanine-crystals. These cause the white colour by
  diffuse reflection of direct light. The cells nearer the surface are charged with oil-drops and
  appear yellow. Large chromatophores are imbedded in the white granular mass, most of them with
  blackish-brown, others with reddish pigment, the granules of which are shifted up and down,
  towards and away from the surface of the cutis, in ramified branches of the chromatophores. When
  these branches are contracted the pigment is conveyed back into the bulbous basal portion of the
  chromatophores and the skin appears yellow or white. When all the pigment is shifted towards the
  surface of the cutis, the animal looks dark, sometimes black. In intermediate conditions the light
  is changed into green by diffraction through the yellowish upper strata and by the finely <span
  class="pagenum" id="page571"><span class="smaller">{571}</span></span>striated iridescent cells of
  the Malpighian layer. Those parts into which the chromatophores do not send pigment appear as
  yellow spots. The chromatophores are to a great extent under control of the will of the Chameleon,
  but external stimuli, as heat and cold and other reflex actions, also play a great part in their
  movements.</p>

  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> who has written a very long but rather confused account.</p>

  <p>The process of moulting is curious. When the Chameleon is in good health the whole process is
  accomplished within a few hours. The skin to be cast off becomes loose and assumes a blistered
  appearance. Sometimes the creature looks as if it were wrapped up in white, semi-transparent
  tissue paper. By rubbing against stones, or between the twigs of trees, the skin comes off in
  large flakes, first on the lips, then on the contorted body, and last on the under surface of the
  hands and feet. During a rapid and successful moult the changes of colour go on as usual in the
  new skin. Sometimes large flakes of the old skin remain adherent for days, especially on the top
  of the head. The moulting takes place several times in one year. One of my <i>Ch. vulgaris</i>
  moulted in January and September, and then not until June of the next following year. A <i>Ch.
  pumilus</i> moulted in the months of May, October, and March.</p>

  <p>When they know themselves to be discovered, Chameleons make themselves as thin as possible by
  compressing the body or rather the belly. This is done by means of the peculiarly elongated
  abdominal ribs described above. The whole body is then put into such a position that, by
  presenting only its narrow edge to the enemy, it has become as little visible as <span
  class="pagenum" id="page572"><span class="smaller">{572}</span></span>possible. At the same time
  the Chameleon turns round upon its twig, so that the latter comes to stand between the observer
  and its own body, which may thereby be completely hidden. When angry, the creature either presents
  its broadest surface, swaying to the right and left, or it blows itself up and hisses. The lungs
  are very capacious, and, instead of being bag-shaped, end in several narrow blind sacs which
  extend far down into the body-cavity, so that not only the chest but the whole body can be blown
  up.</p>

  <p>The usual mode of propagation is by means of eggs, but a few species allied to <i>Ch.
  pumilus</i> are viviparous. The time of incubation and of gestation is long. For instance, the
  pairing of <i>Ch. vulgaris</i> takes place in the month of August. The eggs are laid in the last
  week of October, about fifty to sixty days later. Sometimes, however, the eggs are retained much
  longer, since I have received specimens with ripening eggs in July which did not lay until the end
  of October. The eggs are deposited in the ground and are not hatched until the following February
  or March, <i>i.e.</i> about 130 days later. The new-born little creatures are snowy white, and
  cannot change or rather assume colour until after the second week.</p>

  <p>All Chameleons are insectivorous and require enormous quantities of food, which must be alive
  to be taken. Most of them prefer Orthoptera, <i>e.g.</i> Locusts and Grasshoppers, and
  Lepidoptera. They also eat flies, meal-worms, and cockroaches, but their tastes differ not only
  individually but also temporarily. They require change of diet. One individual will take
  cockroaches greedily, whilst another of the same kind will rather starve itself than touch one.
  The same applies to meal-worms. It is a great but common mistake to suppose that Chameleons do not
  require water. On the contrary they drink regularly and often, generally by licking up drops of
  water or by scooping them up with their lips, shoving the snout along the edges of wet leaves. It
  is not too much to say that most Chameleons are short-lived in captivity on account of the want of
  water. Those which are sold by the dealers are generally in a parched condition. Sprinkling the
  twigs or leaves of their cage with water works a wonderful change in them; the dull,
  apathetic-looking creatures drink and drink, revive, assume brighter colours, and will soon take
  food, which they have until then refused <span class="pagenum" id="page573"><span
  class="smaller">{573}</span></span>obstinately. Once I have even seen a Chameleon, when put into
  the greenhouse, make straight for a tank and actually drink in gulps.</p>

  <p>After they have fattened themselves in the autumn, Chameleons, at least those of North Africa,
  withdraw to hibernate in the ground. But nothing is known about how, when, and where they do this,
  nor is it known if tropical species aestivate during the dry season.</p>

  <p>Chameleons are notoriously difficult to keep successfully, whereby we do not mean the keeping
  for three to six months. This is easy enough, since it takes them several months to die of
  starvation. The difficulty is to keep them through the winter. To enable them to do this, it is
  absolutely necessary to fatten them up during the summer and autumn. Otherwise, although kept in a
  warm place, they are liable to lose their appetite in the autumn, when they become restless,
  probably with the desire to hibernate. Those few individuals which get over this critical period,
  say during the month of October, and do not refuse food, are probably safe. But those are doomed
  which refuse to eat meal-worms or cockroaches or such food as can be procured easily during the
  winter.</p>

  <p>The origin of the Chameleons is unknown. They form only one family, <b>Chamaeleontidae</b>,
  with between fifty and sixty species, which, with a few exceptions, belong to the genus
  <i>Chamaeleon</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. vulgaris</i> is the Common Chameleon of North Africa, Syria, and Asia Minor. It occurs
  also in a few parts of Southern Andalucia, for instance near Jerez, and near Nerja, to the east of
  Malaga, where it has possibly been introduced. A series of conical, slightly enlarged granules
  forms a little crest on the median line of the throat. A whitish line, which does not change
  colour, extends from the chin to the vent. The rest of the skin, with the exception of a median
  dorsal series of slightly enlarged tubercles on part of the back, is composed of small granules. A
  small but distinct lobe of leathery skin extends along either side of the occiput towards the
  posterior end of the median parietal crest. Dead or spirit-specimens are usually pale yellow;
  living ones are greenish, usually with differently coloured patches on the sides. Exceptionally
  large males reach a total length of about 9 inches, females reach the length of perhaps a foot,
  but about half of the total length belongs to the tail.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page574"><span class="smaller">{574}</span></span></div>

  <p>It is impossible to say what is the colour of this Chameleon, since the same specimen may
  within a few days appear in half-a-dozen different garbs, not counting minor combinations of
  colour. After it has been watched for several months, when all its possibilities seem to be
  exhausted, it will probably surprise us by a totally new combination. Not every specimen changes
  alike: some keep the same appearance for a long time, others change often; some are partial to
  specks, others to large patches. In the group of Chameleons shown in Fig. 152 several of the more
  usual arrangements of colour have been indicated by stippling and various kinds of
  cross-hatching.</p>

  <p>C is the same specimen in an excited frame of mind; it is represented in the act of shooting a
  fly. The light brown patches have changed to maroon brown; and many round golden yellow spots have
  appeared on the green parts.</p>

  <p>D shows a specimen, coloured like C, within a few seconds after it has been put into an angry
  mood, in the present case by having its tail squeezed. The whole body is blown out, the thick
  tongue causes the throat to bulge out, and all the yellow spots have become blackish green.</p>

  <p>Many small spots scattered over the body are usually a sign of anger. One of the specimens
  described above was, when fast asleep in a dark room, dirty white, with about two dozen large and
  small round spots of a rich yellow on each side of its body. Then a lighted lamp was brought into
  the room without in any way disturbing the animal. Within sixteen minutes the yellow spots had
  vanished completely; the whole body and tail had become suffused with greenish yellow, which
  gradually turned to pale yellowish green, and those parts which in Fig. B are pale brown, were
  just distinguishable as pale yellowish-white regions. The Chameleon was found to be fast asleep,
  and it kept this coloration during the rest of the evening. Other specimens behaved on similar
  occasions in the same way, but the greatest interest is attached to the fact that frequently only
  that side of the body "greened up" which happened to be exposed to the light, whilst the opposite
  side remained whitish. These changes are not absolutely unconscious; they are, after all, under
  the control of the creature. In order to test the possibility of direct action of the light, I
  have taken the precaution of throwing the light of a candle only upon the body, whilst the head
  was kept in darkness. No changes of colour took place whilst the animal was asleep, but when a
  little light was allowed to sweep across the closed eye, this soon began to twitch, and although
  the creature did not open the eye, the usual changes of colour began to take place. When the light
  was removed, the animal soon re-assumed its whitish appearance. Artificially coloured light, for
  instance green, red, or blue glass or paper, has apparently no influence upon the changes of
  colour. The Chameleons behave as they would behave under ordinary conditions. Direct and hot
  sunshine however causes them to darken, sometimes to turn uniform dull black, except for the white
  median ventral <span class="pagenum" id="page577"><span class="smaller">{577}</span></span>line.
  Occasionally I found one of the specimens described above deep maroon brown, with dozens of round
  orange spots. Blue and red do not seem to be within the range of <i>Ch. vulgaris</i>, but the
  combinations of green, yellow, brown, black, and white, with their various shades, are almost
  endless. Sometimes the Chameleons do not turn pale during the night, but remain more or less dull
  green, with or without brownish patches. Adaptation to their immediate surroundings takes place to
  a very moderate degree only, but as a rule they are brightest, especially in their green tints,
  when they are allowed to sit amongst green foliage. The introduction of a branch with fresh leaves
  generally has a brightening effect upon those which have previously been confined in a cage with
  dry twigs only. Cold does not necessarily make them pale, but they appear duller, and the changes
  take place more slowly. After all, Linnaeus has summed up the little we really know about the
  causes of these changes, in the following terse sentence: "Vivus varios colores assumit secundum
  animi passiones, calorem et frigus."</p>

  <p>Chameleons are not very amiable. When taken up they blow themselves out or they bite painfully,
  and it is a long time before they are tame enough not to go through various antics of anger when
  one approaches them. When taken in the hand they produce a peculiar faint grunting noise, which,
  however, can be better felt than heard. They quarrel much amongst each other; and the males,
  during the pairing season, are particularly ill-tempered. Each individual selects its own
  particular branch to sleep on, if possible a horizontal one, upon which it crouches down
  lengthwise, with the head and belly resting upon the branch. The tail generally makes a turn round
  another branch, and the four legs, grasping some supporting branch, are put into any, sometimes
  into an almost incredibly, awkward position. Although they climb about a good deal during the
  daytime, they generally resort to their accustomed sleeping branch, and they defend this
  vigorously against would-be intruders.</p>

  <p>Chameleons are most deliberate in their movements, sometimes provokingly slow. Each arm and
  foot leaves the firmly grasped branch with great hesitation, and makes with equal deliberation for
  some other foothold. It does not matter if the thigh appears almost twisted out of its joint. The
  creature will <span class="pagenum" id="page578"><span class="smaller">{578}</span></span>remain
  in the most uncomfortable position, forgetting, one might think, to put one or more of its limbs
  down, but keeping them instead in the air.</p>

  <p>It is most interesting to watch them stalking their prey. Suppose we have introduced some
  butterflies into their roomy cage, which is furnished with living plants and with plenty of twigs.
  The Chameleons, hitherto quite motionless, perhaps basking with flattened-out bodies so as to
  catch as many of the sun's rays as possible, become at once lively. One of them makes for a
  butterfly which has settled in the farther upper corner of the cage. With unusually fast motions
  the Chameleon stilts along and across the branches and all seems to go well, until he discovers
  that the end of the branch is still 8 inches from the prey, and he knows perfectly well that 7
  inches are the utmost limit to a shot with his tongue. He pauses to think, perhaps with two limbs
  in the air, but stability is secured by a judicious turn of the tail. After he has solved the
  puzzle, he retraces his steps to the base of the branch, climbs up the main stem, creeps along the
  next branch above, and when arrived at the 7 inch distance, he shoots the butterfly with unerring
  aim. The capacity of the mouth and throat is astonishing. A full-grown Chameleon will catch, chew,
  and swallow the largest moth, for instance a <i>Sphinx ligustri</i>. When large, the prey is
  chewed, but the wings and legs are swallowed with the rest. Occasionally these parts are bitten
  off, especially the prickly long legs of large locusts.</p>

  <p>In water Chameleons are quite helpless. Sometimes they inflate themselves, but they always
  topple over on to the side, and the movements of their limbs are absolutely without any definite
  purpose.</p>

  <p>When the eggs are ripe, and this happens with the Common Chameleon about the end of October,
  the female refuses to take food, and becomes restless. One of my specimens searched about probing
  the ground for about a week before she dug a hole in some more solid soil. This took two days. In
  the evening I found her sitting in the hole to the middle of her body. On the following morning
  she was still there, but busy filling the hole with soil and covering it with dry leaves. A few
  eggs were lying about outside, two of which at least I saw her taking up by the hand and putting
  them on the <span class="pagenum" id="page579"><span class="smaller">{579}</span></span>nest,
  which was found to contain some thirty soft-shelled eggs closely packed upon each other. During
  the whole process she was very snappy, and hissed much when approached. After that she crept into
  the twigs as usual, but refused to eat, vomited at once the artificially introduced food, became
  restless on the sixth day, crawling about at the bottom of the cage, and died on the following
  day. This is the usual fate, almost without exception, of females after they have deposited their
  eggs in captivity. The great number of eggs and their deposition naturally exhausts them, and they
  probably want to hibernate at once. The eggs, which are yellowish, long-oval, about half an inch
  long and covered with a parchment-like shell, are very difficult to rear, chiefly on account of
  the difficulty of regulating the moisture. They shrink up when too dry, and they are very liable
  to become mouldy. According to Fischer<a id="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> the eggs
  can be hatched in a large flower-pot with a layer of horse-droppings at the bottom, then a layer
  of 6 inches of slightly moist soil, then the eggs, then another 6 inches of loose soil, with a
  glass plate covering the top, securing at the same time ventilation. In this way he succeeded in
  hatching several sets of eggs after 125 and 133 days respectively.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. calcaratus</i>, the Indian Chameleon, is found in the southern half of the Peninsula and
  in Ceylon, but it is far from common. It much resembles <i>Ch. vulgaris</i>, but the male is
  distinguished by a tarsal process or "spur," covered with skin, on the inner side of the foot.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. pumilus</i>, the Dwarf Chameleon of South Africa, reaches a total length of 5 to 6
  inches. It has a well-marked, serrated gular crest, which extends from the chin to the end of the
  neck. The chest and belly are without a toothed line, but a strongly serrated series extends from
  the occiput over the back and tail (see the right upper corner of Fig. 152 on <span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page575">575</a></span>). A row of enlarged tubercles or scales extends along the sides
  of the body. The general colour is green, with a large and long patch of brick-red on the sides;
  small dots and spots of intense red are scattered over various parts of the body. The changes of
  colour are rather limited. At night the Dwarf Chameleon does not turn pale, but generally keeps
  its colour. When they are very well the green is quite saturated, and the large red patch on the
  side is <span class="pagenum" id="page580"><span class="smaller">{580}</span></span>interrupted by
  several blue spots. When they are angry or unhappy the red turns into dirty brown, and the green
  becomes quite dull. Sometimes the whole animal turns dull black.</p>

  <p>This pretty little species is relatively hardy, being, as a native of South Africa, accustomed
  to cold nights. It does well in an ordinary temperate greenhouse, where it will live for several
  years, provided it has an ample supply of flies and meal-worms. It is viviparous, the young being
  probably born in the month of March or April.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. bifidus</i>, of Madagascar, shows an extraordinary difference between the sexes. The
  male reaches the great length of 16 inches, and develops two long rostral processes, which extend
  forwards beyond the snout; these processes are formed of dense connective tissue, which ossifies
  in the adult, and they are covered with scaly skin.</p>

  <p><i>Ch. parsoni</i>, likewise of Madagascar, is the giant amongst Chameleons, reaching a total
  length of 2 feet. The male has two large rostral processes which diverge upwards and outwards.</p>

  <p><i>Brookesia</i>, with several species in Madagascar, may be mentioned on account of its
  stunted appearance. The tail is much shorter than the body and scarcely prehensile; the scales on
  the soles are spinous. Total length only about 3 inches.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>Rhampholeon</i>, of tropical continental Africa, with several species, is
  likewise remarkable for the stunted and dwarfed appearance, and for the peculiar claws, each of
  which is furnished with a second cusp which is directed downwards. The tail is much shorter than
  the body. The total length of <i>Rh. spectrum</i> of the Camaroons is about 3 inches.</p>

  apparatus. The reduction of the limbs and the elongation of the body also occurs in many
  Lacertilia; in several of the older families of Snakes (<i>e.g.</i> Typhlopidae and Boidae)
  vestiges of the hind-limbs and even of the pelvis are still in existence. Even the peculiar
  suspensorial apparatus of the lower jaw approaches that of the Lacertilia in the burrowing
  Ilysiidae and in <i>Xenopeltis</i>.</p>

  <p>In the majority of the Snakes the quadrate is very loosely suspended from the squamosal (by
  some authorities homologised with the supratemporal bone of other reptiles), and this again is
  loosely attached to the lateral parietal region of the skull, placed horizontally, and elongated
  so far backwards that the vertically placed quadrate lies in a plane behind the skull. In most
  Snakes the elongated pterygoids are loosely attached to the inner side of the distal end of the
  quadrates, and they also often touch the mandibles. The whole palatal apparatus is movably
  attached to the skull, except in some burrowing families. The right and left pterygoids and
  palatines are widely separated from each other. The pterygoids and maxillaries, connected by the
  ectopterygoids, are absent, owing to reduction, in the <span class="pagenum" id="page582"><span
  class="smaller">{582}</span></span>Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae only. The premaxilla is unpaired
  and small, and is rarely furnished with teeth. The latter are always sharp and recurved, and are
  lodged in sockets upon the edge of the supporting bone, with which they become firmly ankylosed.
  There is a perpetual succession of teeth. In the majority of Snakes teeth are carried by the
  maxillaries, palatines, pterygoids, and dentaries, rarely by the premaxillaries. The palatal teeth
  are restricted to the palatines in <i>Oligodon</i>, <i>Dasypeltis</i>, and <i>Atractaspis</i>
  only.</p>

  <p>Peculiar modifications prevail in the poisonous Snakes. Those maxillary teeth which are at
  their base in connexion with the openings of poison-glands (modified upper labial glands), either
  have a furrow on the anterior side (Proteroglypha if the anterior teeth are grooved, <i>e.g.</i>
  the Cobras; Opisthoglypha if some of the posterior teeth are grooved), or the groove is converted
  into a canal, as in the Solenoglypha or Viperidae. The special modification of the maxillaries of
  the vipers with their long poison-fangs is described on pp. <a href="#page587">587</a> and <a
  href="#page637">637</a>.</p>

  <p>The orbit is generally closed behind by the postfrontal. Quadrato-jugal, postfronto-squamosal,
  and other arches are absent, so that the temporal fossa is quite open (see Fig. 156, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page597">597</a></span>, and Fig. 155, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page596">596</a></span>). The occipital condyle is distinctly triple. The mandibles are
  composed of several bones, but the coronoid is absent in the Xenopeltidae, Colubridae,
  Amblycephalidae, and Viperidae; it is large in the Boidae, reduced to a nodule in the
  Ilysiidae.</p>

  <p>The parietals are always fused into a large unpaired bone, which generally forms a sharp crest
  and partly overlaps the occipitals; there is no interparietal or pineal foramen.</p>

  <p>The vertebral column consists of many, often nearly three hundred vertebrae, and these skeletal
  segments correspond in number with those of the ventral and transverse scales of the skin. The
  vertebrae are procoelous; in addition to the anterior and posterior zygapophyses they have a pair
  of accessory articulations on the neural arches, dorsally to the zygapophyses;&ndash;the
  "zygantrum" carried by the posterior end of the neural arches, its articular surfaces looking
  upwards; and the "zygosphene" carried by the anterior end and looking downwards. Such accessory
  articulations occur also in a few Lizards, <i>e.g.</i> Iguanidae. The vertebrae of many Snakes
  have unpaired vertical, blade-like <span class="pagenum" id="page583"><span
  class="smaller">{583}</span></span>haemapophyses on their centra for the more effective attachment
  of the muscles. All the vertebrae, except the atlas, carry ribs. These articulate by their
  capitular portions only, and are very movable in a head- and tail-ward direction. The ribs being
  long, and fitting with their ventral ends into the connective tissue of the sides of the ventral
  transverse scales, are the principal agents in pushing the body forwards, the posterior edges of
  these scales being sharp and imbricating.</p>

  <p>The skin is covered with scales, absolutely devoid of osteoderms. When the scales are enlarged
  they are called shields. The keel, a common feature, is caused by a slight ridge of the cutaneous
  part of the scale. The whole skin is covered with a thin layer of horny epidermis, which is shed
  frequently, at least several times in one year; the shedding begins at the lips, and the whole
  outer skin is turned inside out from head to tail, retaining every minute detail of the cutaneous
  scales; even the watch-glass-like covering of the eyes is preserved.</p>

  <p>The eyes are peculiar in so far as they possess no lids. The latter are still present in a
  vestigial condition in the embryo, but their place is taken by what is probably a modification of
  the nictitating membrane, which is drawn over the eye and covered with a single transparent scale
  of the horny skin, like a watch-glass. The eyes themselves are quite movable. The "tears," which
  of course cannot appear on the outside, are drained off into the nasal cavities by the
  naso-lacrymal ducts.</p>

  <p>The ear is likewise peculiar. There is a long columellar rod with a fibrous or cartilaginous
  pad at the outer end, which plays against the middle of the shaft of the quadrate, an arrangement
  which, we must assume, produces a thundering noise in the internal ear, since every motion of the
  quadrate during the act of swallowing conveys the vibrations directly to the fenestra ovalis. The
  tympanic cavity, the Eustachian tubes, and the tympanum are abolished, and no external traces of
  the ear are visible. However, in spite of all this, Snakes can hear very well.</p>

  <p>The nose is well developed, and many Snakes, for instance the Grass-Snake, are guided to their
  prey as much by the sense of smell as by the eyes and ears. The tongue is slender, very
  protractile and bifid, always moist, and furnished with many sensory corpuscles. It acts entirely
  as an additional sense-organ, hence the incessant play of the tongue of a snake which wants <span
  class="pagenum" id="page584"><span class="smaller">{584}</span></span>to investigate anything. In
  spite of the protractility of the tongue, the hyoid apparatus is very small; the hyoid arches
  themselves are reduced to mere vestiges near the base of the first and only branchial arches,
  which are thread-like and extend backwards down the throat.</p>

  <p>The trachea is very long, and opens far forwards in the mouth; it can be slightly protruded
  between the two halves of the lower jaw so as not to be blocked during the act of swallowing. This
  is a laborious process. The snake, having got hold of its prey with its teeth, generally shifts it
  into the most convenient position, in order to swallow the head first. One half of the mandible is
  then pushed forwards, then the other half; the recurved teeth afford the necessary hold, and the
  snake, little by little, draws its mouth-cavity, and later on itself, over the prey. In fact, it
  literally gets outside it. Sometimes with a large victim this process may last for hours; the
  whole mouth and head become painfully distended and the veins swollen almost to bursting. The
  snake pushes the prey against a stone or other obstacle, rests awhile quite exhausted, and begins
  afresh. At last the bulk of the prey has passed the mouth, the skin of the neck is stretched to
  the utmost, the scales being separated by wide interstices, the ribs work spasmodically, the
  victim is pressed into the shape of a sausage, and the deed is done. In order to assist
  deglutition there is a great amount of salivation, but the often-heard story that Snakes cover
  their prey with saliva before they swallow it, is a fable, or based upon faulty observation,
  snakes sometimes being forced to disgorge the half-swallowed prey, which, in such a case, is
  covered with slime. One of my tame snakes had swallowed a frog on my table when a friend entered
  the room. The snake was frightened, jumped on to the ground, striking it with its full belly, and
  thereby hurting the frog, which squeaked loudly, whereupon the snake reversed its mechanism and
  the frog hopped away, none the worse for its terrible experience.</p>

  <p>In correlation with the elongated narrow space of the body-cavity the lungs are not equally
  developed, the right being much smaller than the left. The latter is a very thin-walled, hollow
  bag, and the posterior half or third scarcely contains any of the honey-comb-like respiratory
  "cells," but acts merely as a reservoir of air.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page585"><span class="smaller">{585}</span></span></div>

  <p>The cloacal arrangement is essentially the same as that of the Lacertilia, but Snakes possess
  no urinary bladder. The copulatory organs are stowed away beneath the skin in recesses of the
  posterior lateral corners of the shallow cloacal vestibulum. Each organ is generally bifurcated at
  the free end, and furnished with little spike-shaped, but scarcely horny, excrescences. On each
  side of the outer cloacal chamber, in both sexes, lies a roundish gland with an offensive,
  strongly-scented secretion; that of various Boas smells disagreeably sweet and musky. The majority
  of Snakes lay eggs, but most of the Viperidae and the thoroughly aquatic kinds, besides a few
  terrestrial forms, are viviparous. The egg-shells are like parchment, with very little or no
  calcareous deposit, so that they are always soft; many embryos are, however, provided with a
  little "egg-tooth" on the tip of the snout.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 153.</span>&ndash;Map showing the distribution of
      dangerously poisonous snakes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Snakes are intelligent creatures; some become quite affectionate in captivity, but most of them
  are of a morose disposition, and do not care for company.</p>

  <p>The <b>geographical distribution</b> of Snakes has been dealt with in detail in connexion with
  the various families. Unfortunately very few fossils are known. One of the oldest is
  <i>Palaeophis</i>, of the London clay (Lower Eocene). Remains of Elapine and of innocuous
  Colubrine snakes have been found in the Lower Miocene of Germany; Crotaline forms are known from
  the Miocene of Turkey and North America. All the Plistocene <span class="pagenum"
  id="page586"><span class="smaller">{586}</span></span>remains belong to recent genera. There are
  indications that the Ophidia are a relatively young branch of Reptilia, essentially of Tertiary
  date, but the foundations of the distribution of most of the older families were laid in Miocene
  times. The older families, notably those which still possess vestiges of hind-limbs or of the
  pelvis, are circumtropical, <i>e.g.</i> Typhlopidae, Boidae. The few survivors of the Glauconiidae
  are likewise circumtropical, with the exception of Australia. The Ilysiidae occur in South-Eastern
  Asia and in tropical South America; their offshoot the Uropeltidae are restricted to India and
  Ceylon. The Colubridae and even many of their sub-families are cosmopolitan. It is quite possible
  that the Opisthoglypha and Proteroglypha are not natural groups, but that their respective
  conditions have been developed on various occasions and in different countries. The same applies
  more strongly to the Viperidae, a further development of the Opisthoglyphous type. To judge from
  their distribution, the Crotaline snakes were possibly developed in the Palaearctic sub-region;
  they spread all over America, but they were debarred from entering either Australia or Africa. The
  Viperidae, on the other hand, are restricted entirely to the Palaeotropical region and to the
  Palaearctic sub-region. The fact that no separating belt of water existed for them between Europe
  and Africa, indicates their being the most recently developed of poisonous snakes. Madagascar is
  the only large country which, besides snakeless New Zealand, enjoys a total absence of poisonous
  snakes of any kind, while the Oriental is the only sub-region which suffers from the presence of
  numerous species of every sub-family of poisonous Elapine, Crotaline, and Viperine snakes.</p>

  <p><i>Snake-Poison.</i>&ndash;Many Snakes, belonging to different families, are poisonous, and
  unfortunately there is no external character, easily ascertained, by which every poisonous snake
  can be distinguished from a harmless kind. If the head is very broad, this is probably due to the
  pair of poison-glands on the sides of the head; but many harmless snakes can flatten and broaden
  their heads in a suspicious way, and, what is much worse, many of the most poisonous snakes, for
  instance the Cobras, have a head as smooth and as sleek-looking as the Grass- or Ring-Snake, the
  most harmless of species. It so happens that, with a few exceptions, for instance among the
  Crotalines and Vipers, no <span class="pagenum" id="page587"><span
  class="smaller">{587}</span></span>badly poisonous snake has loreal shields, <i>i.e.</i> a pair of
  shields intercalated between the nasals and the preoculars, but this character is obviously no
  good for any practical purposes. Therefore, unless you know a snake well enough when you see it,
  leave it alone, because a mistake may be fatal.</p>

  <p>The poison is secreted in modified upper labial glands, or in a pair of large glands which are
  the homologues of the parotid salivary glands of other animals.<a id="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> A duct passes from the gland forwards along the side of the
  upper jaw. Just in front of the fang it doubles on itself, so as to open by a small papilla on the
  anterior wall of the sheath of mucous membrane which embraces the base of the tooth like a pocket.
  As mentioned before (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page582">582</a></span>), the poison is
  conveyed either along a furrow on the anterior side of the tooth, or the growing substance of the
  tooth partly converts the furrow into a canal which opens only near the end of the tooth. This is
  a perfectly devilish contrivance, ensuring the conveyance of the poison into the very deepest part
  of the wound. The Elapinae have relatively short fangs, while those of the Vipers, and especially
  those of the Crotaline snakes, are much longer, sometimes measuring nearly an inch in length. The
  most formidable apparatus is that of the Viperidae, since in them the maxillaries, each provided
  with only one acting fang, and without any other teeth behind, can be erected. The mechanism is
  explained in Fig. 154 and Fig. 179 (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page647">647</a></span>). The
  apparatus of the upper jaw is so constructed that the pushing forwards of the horizontal pterygoid
  bar will, by acting on the ectopterygoid, rotate and erect the short maxillary. The pulling
  forwards is effected by contraction of the spheno-pterygoid muscle, which arises far forwards from
  the basal orbito-sphenoid region, and is inserted on to the inner dorsal surface of the pterygoid.
  The principal closing muscles of the mouth are the temporo-masseteric muscles (Fig. 179,
  <i>T.a.</i> and <i>T.p.</i>) and the inner and outer pterygoid muscles, which latter arise from
  the outer surface of the pterygoid bone, or from the maxillary, and are inserted on to the
  articular region of the mandible.</p>

  <p>A strong ligament arises from the squamoso-quadrate junction, and spreads fan-shaped upon the
  connective tissue <span class="pagenum" id="page588"><span class="smaller">{588}</span></span>wall
  of the poison-gland; the anterior and posterior ends of the gland are held by another strong band,
  which stretches from the maxilla to the mandibular joint. The whole is so arranged that the acts
  of opening the jaws (by the digastric muscles) and the erection of the fang-bearing maxillaries
  are enough to mechanically squeeze the contents out of the poison-gland. A portion of the anterior
  temporal muscle is attached to the capsule of the poison-gland.</p>

  <p>An excellent account of the nature and of the effect of the venom of Snakes has been written by
  Charles J. Martin.<a id="NtA_175" href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> The following condensed
  account has been abstracted from it:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"The poison is a clear, pale yellow, or straw-coloured fluid, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page589"><span class="smaller">{589}</span></span>which reacts acid, and contains about 30 per
  cent of solids, but this varies much according to the state of concentration. Most venoms are
  tasteless, but Cobra poison is said to be disagreeably bitter. Dried venom keeps indefinitely, and
  dissolves readily in water. It keeps also in glycerine. It contains albuminous bodies in solution.
  The venom is, in fact, a pure solution of two or more poisonous proteids, which are the active
  agents, with a small quantity of an organic acid or colouring matter. The venom is destroyed by
  reagents which precipitate proteids in an insoluble form, or which destroy them, <i>e.g.</i>
  silver nitrate or permanganate of potash. Hypochlorites have the same effect. Carbolic acid and
  caustic potash destroy it only after a day or two.</p>

  <p>"The venom is generally introduced into the subcutaneous tissue, whence it reaches the general
  circulation by absorption through the lymph and blood-vessels. When introduced directly into a
  vein, the effects are instantaneous. It is absorbed by the conjunctiva, but, excepting Cobra
  poison, not by the mouth or alimentary canal, provided there be no hollow teeth or no abrasions.
  The venom of the various kinds of Snakes acts differently.</p>

  <p>"The symptoms of Cobra poison. Burning pain, followed by sleepiness, and weakness in the legs
  after half an hour. Then profuse salivation, paralysis of the tongue and larynx, and inability to
  speak. Vomiting. Incapability of movement. The patient seems to be conscious, but is unable to
  express himself. The breathing becomes difficult. The heart's action is quickened. The pupil
  remains contracted and reacts to light. At length breathing ceases, with or without convulsions,
  and the heart slowly stops. Should the patient survive, he returns rapidly to complete health.</p>

  <p>"The symptoms of Rattle-snake poison. The painful wound is speedily discoloured and swollen.
  Constitutional symptoms appear as a rule in less than fifteen minutes: prostration, staggering,
  cold sweats, vomiting, feeble and quick pulse, dilatation of the pupil, and slight mental
  disturbance. In this state the patient may die in about twelve hours. If he recovers from the
  depression, the local symptoms begin to play a much more important part than in Cobra poisoning:
  great swelling and discoloration extending up the limb and trunk, rise of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page590"><span class="smaller">{590}</span></span>temperature and repeated syncope, and
  laboured respiration. Death may occur in this stage. The local haemorrhagic extravasation
  frequently suppurates, or becomes gangrenous, and from this the patient may die even weeks
  afterwards. Recovery is sudden, and within a few hours the patient becomes bright and
  intelligent.</p>

  <p>"Symptoms of bite from the European Viper. Local burning pain; the bitten limb soon swells and
  is discoloured. Great prostration, vomiting, and cold, clammy perspiration follow within one to
  three hours. The pulse is very feeble, with slight difficulty in breathing, and restlessness. In
  severe cases the pulse may become imperceptible, the extremities may become cold, and the patient
  may pass into coma. In from twelve to twenty-four hours these severe constitutional symptoms
  usually pass off, but in the meantime the swelling and discoloration have spread enormously.
  Within a few days recovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but death may occur from the severe
  depression, or from the secondary effects of suppuration.</p>

  <p>"Symptoms of bite from the Daboia or <i>Vipera russelli</i>. These resemble the effects of
  Rattle-snake poison, but sanious discharges from the rectum, etc., are an additional and prominent
  feature. The recovering patient suffers from haemorrhagic extravasations in various organs,
  besides from the lungs, nose, mouth, and bowels. Kidney haemorrhage and albuminuria is a constant
  symptom. The pupil is always dilated and insensitive to light.</p>

  <p>"Symptoms of bite of Australian Elapine snakes. Pain and local swelling. The first
  constitutional symptoms appear in fifteen minutes to two hours. First faintness, and an
  irresistible desire to sleep. Then alarming prostration and vomiting. The pulse is extremely
  feeble and thread-like, and uncountable. The limbs are cold, and the skin is blanched. Respiration
  becomes shallow with the increasing coma. Sensation is blunted. The pupil is widely dilated, and
  insensible to light. There is sometimes passing of blood. If the patient survives the coma,
  recovery is complete and as a rule rapid, without secondary symptoms. The Australian venom and
  that of all viperine snakes, perhaps also that of the Cobra, if introduced rapidly into the
  circulation, occasions extensive intravascular clotting. If the venom is slowly absorbed, the
  blood loses its coagulability, <span class="pagenum" id="page591"><span
  class="smaller">{591}</span></span>owing to the breaking down of the red blood-corpuscles, most so
  with vipers, less with Australian snakes, least so with the Cobra. The Cobra venom is supposed to
  extinguish the functions of the various nerve-centres of the cerebro-spinal system, the
  paralysation extending from below upwards, and it has a special affinity for the respiratory
  centre. The toxicity or relative strength of the Cobra venom has been calculated to be sixteen
  times that of the European Viper. Snakes can poison each other, even those of the same kind.</p>

  <p>"<i>Treatment.</i>&ndash;Apply a ligature above, not on the top of the situation of the bite;
  twist the string tightly with a stick. Then make a free incision into the wound. Sucking out is
  dangerous! Then bandage the limb downwards, progressing towards the wound; repeat this several
  times. Direct application into the widened wound of calcium hypochlorite, i.e. bleaching powder,
  is very good, or of a 1 per cent solution of permanganate of potash, or Condy's fluid. Amputation
  of the finger is the best remedy of all if a large snake has bitten it. Do not keep the ligature
  longer than half an hour. Then let the circulation return, and apply the ligature again. In any
  case, do not keep the ligature on for more than one hour for fear of gangrene.</p>

  <p>"<i>Internal remedies.</i>&ndash;The administration of enormous doses of alcohol is to be
  condemned strongly; small stimulating doses are good, but stimulation can be more effectively
  produced by ammonia or strychnia. Hypodermic injection of strychnine, in some cases as much as one
  to two grains (but not into a vein!) has in some cases had good results; but injection of ammonia,
  instead of doing any good, has disastrous sloughing results. There is only one fairly reliable
  treatment, that by serum therapeutics, the injection of considerable quantities of serum of
  animals which have been partially immunised by repeated doses of snake-venom. Unfortunately this
  treatment will not often be available."</p>

  <p>Several well-known Mammals and Birds are immune by nature against snake-venom, but most of them
  avoid being bitten. Some birds induce the snake to strike and bite frequently into their
  spread-out wings. Such more or less immune creatures are the Mongoose, the Hedgehog, and the Pig,
  the Secretary bird, the Honey Buzzard, the Stork and probably other snake-eaters.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Typhlopidae.</b>&ndash;Burrowing snakes which have the whole body covered with
  uniform cycloid scales, and with the teeth restricted to the small and transversely placed
  maxillary bones. The pterygoids do not extend backwards to the quadrates, and there are no
  endopterygoids. The quadrates slant obliquely forwards, and are attached directly to the
  pro-otics, <span class="pagenum" id="page594"><span class="smaller">{594}</span></span>owing to
  the absence of squamosal bones. The prefrontals are in lateral contact with the nasals. There are
  vestiges of the pelvis, reduced to a single bone on each side. The eyes are hidden by shields of
  the skin.</p>

  <p>The Typhlopidae, mainly composed of the genus <i>Typhlops</i>, with about one hundred species,
  are undoubtedly the last living descendants of formerly cosmopolitan, rather archaic, snakes,
  which in adaptation to their burrowing life and insectivorous diet have undergone degradation.
  They are still widely distributed in all tropical and sub-tropical countries, some on the solitary
  Christmas Island, but not in New Zealand. One species, <i>T. vermicularis</i>, inhabits the Balkan
  Peninsula and South-West Asia. It is brown above, yellowish below, and reaches a length of about
  10 inches. The tail is extremely short and ends in a horny spine. <i>T. braminus</i> is widely
  distributed in Southern Asia, the Malay Islands, the islands in the Indian Ocean and in Southern
  Africa.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Glauconiidae.</b>&ndash;In most respects resembling the Typhlopidae, but the
  maxillaries retain their normal position and are toothless, teeth being restricted to the lower
  jaw, which is stout and short. The pelvic girdle and the hind-limbs show the least reduction found
  in any recent Snakes; in the pelvis the ilia, pubes, and ischia can still be distinguished, the
  last even retaining their symphysis; there are also vestiges of femurs. About thirty species,
  nearly all belonging to the genus <i>Glauconia</i>, are found in South-Western Asia, Africa, and
  the warmer parts of America, including the West Indies.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Ilysiidae.</b>&ndash;The scales of the cylindrical body are smooth and small, those
  on the ventral side are scarcely larger. The tail is extremely short and blunt. The head is very
  small, not distinct from the neck. The gape of the mouth is very narrow. Teeth are carried by the
  mandibles, the pterygoids, palatines, maxillaries, and one or two or more by the premaxillae. The
  endopterygoids are short. An important cranial feature is the short quadrates, which stand rather
  vertically and are connected with the cranium by the squamosals; these are very small and are
  firmly wedged in between the upper ends of the quadrates and the pro-otic, lateral, and
  supra-occipital bones; now forming part of the cranial wall. Vestiges of the pelvis and hind-limbs
  are very incomplete, and terminate in claw-like spurs, <span class="pagenum" id="page595"><span
  class="smaller">{595}</span></span>protruding between the scales on either side of the vent. The
  eyes are very small, and are either free or covered by transparent shields. The few, scarcely
  half-a-dozen, species are found in South America (<i>Ilysia</i>) and in Ceylon, the Malay Islands,
  and Indo-China.</p>

  <p><i>Ilysia</i> (<i>Tortrix</i>) <i>scytale</i>, the Coral-Snake of Tropical South America, is a
  beautiful coral-red with black rings. On account of its beauty, perfectly harmless nature, and for
  "cooling purposes," this snake, which grows to nearly a yard in length, is sometimes worn as a
  necklace by native ladies. All the Ilysiidae lead a partly burrowing life, live chiefly upon
  worms, insects, and little Typhlopidae, and are viviparous.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Uropeltidae.</b>&ndash;Burrowing snakes of Ceylon and Southern India, with a short
  and rigid cylindrical body and a very short tail, which ends in a large peculiar shield, often
  obliquely truncated. The scales of the body are smooth, and are little larger on the belly; the
  coloration is mostly very beautiful. The eyes are very small.</p>

  <p>The Uropeltidae are somewhat intermediate between the Ilysiidae, Glauconiidae, and Boidae. The
  pterygoids do not reach the quadrates; but ectopterygoids are present; the quadrates are very
  small and directly attached to the skull, squamosals being absent. Teeth are carried by the
  mandibles and by the maxillaries, which are normal in their position. There are no vestiges of
  hind-limbs or of the pelvis. The Uropeltidae, of which about forty species are known, are
  viviparous, burrow in the ground, and frequent damp localities, preferring mountain-forests. The
  use of the characteristic tail-shield is not clear; perhaps it assists these rather rigid
  creatures in digging, by being pressed against the ground.</p>

  <p><i>Uropeltis.</i>&ndash;The tail is obliquely truncated, ending in a roundish, flat shield.</p>

  <p><i>U. grandis</i> s. <i>philippinus</i>.&ndash;The latter name seems to have misled W.
  Marshall<a id="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> into including the Philippine Islands
  in the range of the family, a mistake which is sure to be propagated. The species, the only one of
  the genus, is confined to Ceylon; it is blackish above, yellow below, frequently with small yellow
  spots above and brown spots on the under surface. It grows to about 18 inches in length.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page596"><span class="smaller">{596}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Rhinophis.</i>&ndash;The tail-shield is convex and the snout is pointed. <i>Rh.
  sanguineus</i> of Southern India is black above with a bluish gloss, sometimes with small pale
  specks; the belly and several of the lateral series of scales are bright red, spotted with black.
  The tail-shield is black and red.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Boidae.</b>&ndash;Typical Snakes, usually large, and with vestiges of pelvis and
  hind-limbs, appearing externally as claw-like spurs on each side of the vent. The scales of the
  upper surface are usually small and smooth, while those of the ventral surface form one broad
  series on the belly, and one or two rows on the tail. The quadrate is carried by the horizontally
  elongated squamosal, which rests loosely upon the lateral occipital region. The prefrontal is in
  contact with the nasal. Teeth are carried by the mandibles, the pterygoids, palatines,
  maxillaries, and, in the Pythoninae, by the premaxillaries also. For further details see Figs.
  155, 156.</p>

  <p>The Boidae comprise between sixty and seventy species, which have been grouped into many
  genera, on unimportant characters, referring to the scales and shields of the head. It is doubtful
  if they are natural groups, a consideration which detracts much from their value in the study of
  geographical distribution. Even the two sub-families are not free from this reproach. The range of
  the family is world-wide, Boidae occurring in all tropical and sub-tropical countries, including
  islands, except New Zealand. A few species live in South-Eastern Europe (<i>Eryx</i>) and in
  North-Western America. They mostly prefer wooded districts, especially forests; climbing trees,
  assisted by the short and partly prehensile tail. Others are semi-aquatic, and a few live in sandy
  localities. They are all rapacious, and by preference feed on warm-blooded creatures, which they
  constrict by coils of the body in order to hold, kill, and crush the victim before swallowing it.
  Exaggerated notions are entertained about their swallowing capacity. It is obvious that a large
  snake, 20 feet long, half a foot thick, and weighing several hundred pounds, can crush a tiger, a
  stag, or even a <span class="pagenum" id="page598"><span class="smaller">{598}</span></span>cow;
  but common sense tells us where to draw the line when it comes to the swallowing of the prey.
  Small game, although of a bulk apparently far too big for the snake, is so crushed and mangled
  that it is turned into the shape of a sausage preparatory to the long process of swallowing. The
  Boidae lay eggs, and some species incubate them, or rather the female coils herself round them for
  the sake of protection. No appreciable amount of extra warmth is developed. Unfortunately the
  observations of one of the best cases on record<a id="NtA_183" href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>
  were conducted so imperfectly that they are of little value.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Pythoninae.</b>&ndash;With a pair of supra-orbital bones, intercalated between
  the prefrontal, frontal, and postfrontal bones. The sub-caudal scales are mostly in two rows. The
  premaxilla often carries a few small teeth.</p>

  <p>The Pythoninae, comprising about twenty species, are restricted to the Palaeotropical and
  Australian regions, with the sole exception of <i>Loxocemus bicolor</i> in Southern Mexico.</p>

  <p><i>Python</i>, the principal genus, has teeth on the premaxilla. The rostral, each of the
  anterior upper labials, and some of the lower labial shields, contain a deep, probably sensory,
  pit. The maxillary and mandibular teeth are long, but decrease from before backwards. The head is
  distinct from the neck, and is covered with symmetrical shields or with small scales. The scales
  of the body are small and smooth. The tail is short and prehensile; below with two rows of scales.
  The pupil of the eye is vertical. The range of the genus extends over the whole of the
  Palaeotropical and Australian regions, excepting Madagascar and New Zealand.</p>

  <p><i>P. spilotes</i>, the "Carpet Snake" of Australia and New Guinea, is mostly beautifully
  marked, but is subject to much variation in colour. The more typical specimens are black above,
  each scale with a yellowish dot, with yellow spots or combinations of dots, more or less arranged
  in rows. The under parts are yellow. It reaches a length of about two yards, and spends a great
  part of its time in trees.</p>

  <p><i>P. reticulatus</i> is the commonest species in Indo-China and in the Malay Islands. Four
  upper labial shields of each side are pitted. The specific name refers to the bold, dark,
  lozenge-shaped markings upon the lighter yellowish or brown ground. A black <span class="pagenum"
  id="page599"><span class="smaller">{599}</span></span>line extends over the head from the nose to
  the neck, and another on each side from the eye to the angle of the mouth. The under parts are
  mostly yellowish, with small brown spots on the sides.</p>

  <p>This is one of the largest species of Python, some specimens being known which measured about
  30 feet in length.</p>

  <p>As a sample of folk-lore connected with this monstrous snake the following Burmese fable has
  been recorded by Mason:&ndash;<a id="NtA_184" href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"According to a Karen legend all the poisonous serpents derive their virulence from the Python,
  which, though innocuous now, was originally the only one that was venomous. In those days he was
  perfectly white, but having seduced away a man's wife, Aunt Eu (Eve), he made her, while she was
  in his den, weave figures on his skin in the forms which are now seen. At that time, if he bit the
  footstep of a man in the road, such was the virulence of his poison that the man died, how far
  soever that man might have passed from the bitten track. The Python had not, however, an ocular
  demonstration of the fact, so he said to the Crow: 'Crow, go and see whether people die or not
  when I bite the foot-track.' The Crow went to the neighbourhood of a Karen cabin, and found the
  people, as is their custom at funerals, laughing, singing, dancing, jumping, and beating drums. He
  therefore returned to the Python, and told him that so far from <span class="pagenum"
  id="page600"><span class="smaller">{600}</span></span>his efforts producing death, on the contrary
  they produced joy. The Python was so angry when he heard this that he ascended a tree and spit up
  all his venom, but other creeping things came and swallowed it, and people die of their malignancy
  to this day. The tree, therefore, from which the Python spat up his venom became deadly, and its
  juice is used to this day for the purpose of poisoning arrows. The Python made the other creatures
  promise not to bite without provocation. The Cobra said: 'If there be transgression so as to
  dazzle my eyes, to make my tears fall seven times in one day, I will bite.' So said the Tiger
  (whose bite the Karens esteem as virulent as a serpent's) and others, and they were allowed to
  retain their poison. But the Water Snake and Frog said they would bite with or without cause as
  they liked; so the Python drove them into the water, where their poison melted away and their bite
  became harmless."</p>

  <p><i>P. molurus</i> is the species of India and Ceylon, ranging, however, also into Indo-China.
  Boulenger quotes W. Elliot<a id="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page601"><span class="smaller">{601}</span></span>as the authority for the
  statement that this species grows to the length of 30 feet. Only two pairs of upper labials are
  pitted. The general colour above is greyish or yellowish brown with a dorsal series of large
  reddish-brown, black-edged patches, and on the sides of the body with a series of smaller spots
  with light centres. On the head is a lance-shaped marking; a brown stripe passes from the eye
  backwards. The under parts are yellowish.</p>

  <p><i>P. sebae</i> and <i>P. regius</i> are African species. The former has two pairs of upper
  labials pitted, the latter four pairs. <i>P. sebae</i> is generally pale brown above with dark
  brown, black-edged cross-bars, which are usually connected by a sinuous dark stripe along each
  side of the back. The upper surface of the tail has a light stripe between two black stripes. The
  belly is spotted and dotted with dark brown. <i>P. sebae</i> ranges over the whole of Tropical and
  Southern Africa, perhaps with the exception of Eastern Africa. <i>P. regius</i> of West Africa is
  beautifully marked, and may be recognised by the dark brown, black-edged band along the back,
  sending down triangular or <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped processes on the sides, which
  are pale brown. This dorsal band encloses a light streak on the neck and another on the tail. The
  belly is yellowish.</p>

  <p>These African Pythons grow to a length of about 15 feet, but specimens so large as this are not
  often met with. The negroes of certain parts of the coast of Guinea are said to worship them and
  to keep them in special temples, where they are regularly attended to. Their food consists chiefly
  of small Mammals, notably rats, and of Birds. A couple of these snakes paired in the Zoological
  Gardens of London in the month of June. The female laid nearly one hundred eggs in the following
  January, and incubated them until April, when the embryos were found to be still unripe.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Boinae.</b>&ndash;Without supra-orbital bones. The premaxilla is toothless. The
  subcaudal scales form mostly a single row.</p>

  <p>The Boinae comprise between forty and fifty species. Most of them are American, but the genus
  <i>Eryx</i> inhabits North Africa, Greece, and South-Western Asia; the genus <i>Enygrus</i>
  inhabits New Guinea and many of the Pacific Islands, for instance New Britain (Neu Pommern), the
  Solomon, Loyalty and Fiji Islands, <span class="pagenum" id="page602"><span
  class="smaller">{602}</span></span>and the New Hebrides. <i>Casarea dussumieri</i> is found on
  Round Island near Mauritius; and two species of <i>Boa</i> and one of <i>Corallus</i> represent
  the Boidae in Madagascar, while all the others live in Central and South America.</p>

  <p><i>Boa.</i>&ndash;The maxillary and mandibular teeth gradually decrease in size. The scales of
  the upper parts of the body and tail are smooth and very small. The rostral shield is enlarged.
  The nostrils are placed between two or three nasals, and these are separated from those of the
  other side by small scales. The tail is short and prehensile. The pupil is vertical.</p>

  <p><i>B. constrictor</i>, of South America, has the head covered with small scales, one of the
  pre-oculars being enlarged. The eye is separated from the labials by several series of tiny
  scales. The general colour is a delicate "pale brown above, with fifteen to twenty dark brown
  cross-bars widening on each side, and, if connected by a dark dorso-lateral streak, enclosing
  large elongate oval spots.... On each side is a series of large dark brown spots with light
  centres, most of which alternate with the cross-bars. On the tail the markings become much larger,
  brick-red, edged with black, and separated by narrow, yellowish interspaces." Under parts
  yellowish with black dots. <i>Boa constrictor</i>, a name applied in popular parlance to many
  species, reaches a length of more than 10 feet; the largest specimen in the British Museum
  measures exactly 11 feet. A few other species inhabit Central America and the West Indies. <i>B.
  dumerili</i> and <i>B. madagascariensis</i>, both of Madagascar, cannot be separated from the
  genus <i>Boa</i>.</p>

  <p>A. D. Bartlett<a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> has described the following
  incident:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"In the evening of 5th October 1892 two pigeons were put into the cage in which two fine
  specimens of <i>Boa constrictor</i> had been living on friendly terms since the beginning of the
  year. The larger snake seized one of the pigeons and the keeper left the house. The next morning
  only one of the snakes, the larger specimen, was visible, and from its enormously extended body it
  was evident that it had swallowed its companion, which was about 9 feet in length. It had no
  longer the power of curling itself round, but remained extended nearly to its full length in a
  straight line, and appeared to be at least three times its normal circumference. It was almost
  painful to see the distended skin, <span class="pagenum" id="page603"><span
  class="smaller">{603}</span></span>which had separated the scales all over the middle of the body.
  By 2nd November, twenty-eight days later, the snake had not only digested its companion but had
  regained its appetite as well as its normal size, and it immediately swallowed a pigeon put into
  its den."</p>

  <p>This peculiar case is not one of ordinary cannibalism. It is rather an unintentional accident.
  When two snakes happen to get hold of the same animal (in the present case a pigeon) and begin to
  swallow it, the action of swallowing becomes almost mechanical, the snakes continuing to push
  their jaws over the prey&ndash;which in the case of a bird or mammal they cannot taste, nor can
  they see it&ndash;so long as they feel something in the mouth. After the original prey has been
  mastered, it is the turn of the opposite snake's head, and if the weaker snake does not give way
  it is swallowed by its stronger mate. Grass-Snakes will swallow several frogs if these are tied
  together in a string, and other snakes do the same with mice. There are instances on record in
  which a <i>Python</i> swallowed its blanket, which, being absolutely indigestible, caused its
  death.</p>

  id="page604"><span class="smaller">{604}</span></span>specimen from which the figure was drawn.
  The general colour is dark olive-brown, with large oval black spots arranged in two more or less
  alternating rows along the back, and with smaller black, white-eyed spots along the sides. The
  under parts are whitish, spotted with black. The upper parts of this and of many other
  dark-coloured species of Boidae are often shiny, with an iridescent lustre.</p>

  <p>The Anaconda combines an arboreal with an aquatic life, a kind of existence eminently in
  harmony with the well-watered, dense forests of Tropical South America, which are the home of
  this, the largest of all modern Snakes. It is said to attain a length of as much as 33 feet. There
  is no inherent impossibility in such statements, but the giant specimens seem to have a knack of
  keeping out of the naturalist's way.</p>

  <p>The Anaconda feeds chiefly upon Birds and Mammals, which it catches either on land, mostly
  during the night-time, or in the water. For the latter purpose it lies submerged in the rivers or
  floats about leisurely, only the head being above the surface, and anything suitable is attacked.
  In other localities the snake, if so inclined, establishes itself upon the branches of a tree
  which overhangs the water, or the track of the game. These aquatic Snakes seem to be
  viviparous.</p>

  <p><i>Eryx</i> has the head not distinct from the neck and covered entirely with small scales.
  Those of the body are likewise small, and are either smooth or keeled. The tail is very short. The
  anterior maxillary and mandibular teeth are longer than the posterior teeth. These snakes, most of
  which are less than 3 feet in length, inhabit the sandy districts of North Africa, Arabia, and
  South-Western Asia, extending into Central Asia. One species, <i>E. jaculus</i>, extends into
  Greece and the Ionian Islands. Like the other species it is an ugly creature, pale grey or
  yellowish above, with darker patches and spots. The under parts are whitish. The scales are smooth
  on the front half of the body, becoming keeled further back and on the tail. Total length under 2
  feet. The pupil is vertical.</p>

  <p>According to Zander<a id="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> and Werner<a
  id="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> this snake lives in sandy localities, digging
  itself into the sand, or covering the body lightly with sand and leaving only the eyes and
  nostrils free. The whole body is very flabby, and presses itself into any irregularity of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page605"><span class="smaller">{605}</span></span>ground over which the
  snake creeps. Some specimens live on lizards, others prefer mice. The prey is caught by the head,
  and further secured by several turns of the body of the captor, whose tail is then turned
  forwards, round the head of the victim, so as to form a kind of knot.</p>

  <p>Not less striking than their agility is their jealousy, which is so strong that a snake will
  occasionally leave the mouse which it has just strangled in order to seize another snake's mouse.
  Sometimes several snakes fight for the same mouse, coiled together into one inextricable lump so
  that the mouse itself is quite invisible. The snakes poke their heads about in search of the
  hidden prey, and every attempt of one of the snakes to free itself, causes the others to squeeze
  it firmer and firmer, thinking apparently that the motion was caused by the lost prey.</p>

  <p>Occasionally one of Werner's captives caught several mice in succession. With these it crawled
  into a corner, dropped the mice, and then proceeded quietly to swallow one after another. After a
  fortnight the whole repast was digested, and the snake was ready for more.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Xenopeltidae.</b>&ndash;The single species, <i>Xenopeltis unicolor</i>, of
  South-Eastern Asia, including the Malay Islands, has been raised to the dignity of family-rank on
  account of the following combination of characters. The prefrontal bones are still in contact with
  the nasals as in the previous families, but the coronoid bones of the mandibles are absent as in
  the remaining families. The whole suspensorial apparatus and the lower jaw itself are peculiar.
  The dentary bone is movably attached to the end of the much-elongated articular bone, the
  movability being enhanced by the absence of the coronoid element.<a id="NtA_189"
  href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> The quadrate is short and thick, and is carried by the short
  and broad squamosal, which lies flat against the skull, resembling in this respect that of some of
  the Ilysiidae. Boulenger rightly considers <i>Xenopeltis</i> to be in various ways intermediate
  between this family, the Boidae and the Colubridae. The head is small and not distinct from the
  neck. The eyes are small and have a vertical pupil. The body is cylindrical, covered above with
  <span class="pagenum" id="page606"><span class="smaller">{606}</span></span>smooth black or brown
  and highly iridescent scales, hence the generic name. The ventral scales are white and
  transversely enlarged as in the majority of snakes. The tail is short, but not stunted, measuring
  about 4 inches in full-grown specimens of a total length of 3 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Colubridae.</b>&ndash;This family comprises those snakes (about nine-tenths of all
  recent species) which combine the following characters:&ndash;ectopterygoids are present: the
  squamosals are loosely attached to the skull, and carry the quadrates, which are not reached by
  the pterygoids: the prefrontals are not in contact with the nasals: the maxillaries are horizontal
  and form the greater portion of the upper jaws: the mandibles lack the coronoid process or
  element: both jaws are toothed.</p>

  <p>The best arrangement of this enormous cosmopolitan family with terrestrial, arboreal, and
  aquatic forms, is that by Boulenger, who, adopting Dum&eacute;ril's terms, has divided them into three
  parallel series.</p>

  <p>A. <i>Aglypha.</i>&ndash;All the teeth are solid and not grooved.</p>

  <p>B. <i>Opisthoglypha.</i>&ndash;One or more of the posterior maxillary teeth are grooved.</p>

  <p>C. <i>Proteroglypha.</i>&ndash;The anterior maxillary teeth are grooved or "perforated."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Aglypha are harmless, non-poisonous. Most of the Opisthoglypha are poisonous,
  although few of them are dangerously so. The Proteroglypha, which comprise the "Cobras" and their
  allies, are deadly poisonous.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series A. AGLYPHA.</b></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Acrochordinae.</b>&ndash;The postfrontal bones, besides bordering the orbits
  posteriorly, are extended forwards so as to form the upper border of the orbits, separating the
  latter from the frontals. The few genera and species of this sub-family are mostly aquatic,
  inhabiting rivers, or estuaries with brackish water, and they have been known to swim far out into
  the sea. The body is covered with small, frequently granular scales; in the typically aquatic
  forms the body is slightly compressed laterally, and the ventral scales are scarcely larger than
  the others. Most of these ugly snakes inhabit the rivers of coasts of South-Eastern Asia and
  Papuasia; one, <i>Stoliczkaia</i>, is found in the Khasia Hills <span class="pagenum"
  id="page607"><span class="smaller">{607}</span></span>of North-Eastern India; another,
  <i>Nothopsis</i>, lives far from its supposed allies, on the Isthmus of Darien, Central
  America.</p>

  <p><i>Acrochordus javanicus</i> has no ventral shields. The head is flat, covered with small
  granules, with the eyes and nostrils on the upper surface. The general colour is dull olive-brown,
  lighter and spotted beneath. The food consists of fishes. Total length up to 4 feet.</p>

  <p><i>Chersydrus granulatus</i> ranges from the coast of Madras to New Guinea. The body and tail
  are compressed, and form a ventral fold, covered with tiny scales like the rest of the body.
  General colour grey above, yellow below.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Colubrinae.</b>&ndash;The postfrontal bones are restricted to the posterior
  border of the orbits. The maxillary and dentary bones carry teeth on their whole length. The
  scales are usually imbricating. This sub-family contains the overwhelming majority of snakes,
  about 1000 species, all of them harmless so far as poison is concerned. None of them reach a great
  size, species of 6 or 7 feet in length being rare, e.g. <i>Zamenis mucosus</i>, but a few species
  of the Indian genus <i>Zaocys</i> s. <i>Coryphodon</i> grow to 10 feet. Most of the Colubrine
  snakes are oviparous, but some, e.g. <i>Coronella</i>, are viviparous. Some are aquatic, or
  semi-aquatic, others are absolutely arboreal, others again prefer dry, sandy, or rocky localities,
  according to their food. The distribution of the sub-family is cosmopolitan, finding its natural
  limits only in the permanently frozen under-ground, a condition which makes hibernation
  impossible. Most of them love warmth and like to bask, although many are not fond of the broiling
  sun. In the temperate regions they hibernate. As a rule they are intelligent and some of them
  become even affectionate.</p>

  <p><i>Tropidonotus.</i>&ndash;The teeth form closely set series on the whole length of the
  maxillaries, palatines, pterygoids, and the greater portion of the dentaries. The premaxilla is
  toothless. The teeth of the maxillaries gradually increase in length, the posterior teeth being
  the longest. The pupil is round. There is a pair of internasal shields. The scales covering the
  body have each an apical, sensory pit, are mostly keeled, and are arranged in longitudinal series.
  The ventral shields are broad; the sub-caudals form two rows. This genus, with more than seventy
  species, has a wide range, practically over the whole world with the exception of New Zealand and
  the southern half of Australia.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page608"><span class="smaller">{608}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>T. natrix</i>, the common Grass-Snake, has a divided, or double, anal shield. The strongly
  keeled scales of the body form nineteen rows. There are normally seven upper labials, the third
  and fourth of which border the eye. The usual colour of the Grass-Snake is olive-grey or brown
  above, with black spots and narrow cross-bands. The labials are white or yellowish, with black
  sutures. The belly is checkered black and white, more or less suffused with grey. There are
  several colour-varieties. The typical or northern form has a white, yellow, or orange collar,
  bordered behind by a black collar; the pale collar is sometimes faint or absent. The second
  variety, rather common in Spain and Portugal, although not the only form in the Peninsula, has no
  collar whatever, and these specimens are sometimes almost uniformly grey-green above. The third
  variety, common in South-Eastern Europe and in Asia Minor, has a well-marked collar and a
  yellowish streak along each side of the back. But there are also almost black specimens.</p>

  <p>The usual length of an adult female Grass-Snake is about 3 feet, but very exceptional cases of
  more than 6 feet are on record; the males are smaller and more slenderly built. The range extends
  over the whole of Middle Europe, Algeria, West and Central Asia. It does not, however, occur in
  Ireland or Scotland. Its northern limit is the southern part of Sweden.</p>

  <p>The Grass-Snake prefers moist, grassy localities, with the neighbourhood of water, chiefly on
  account of the food, which consists entirely of fishes and Amphibia, notably of frogs; tree-frogs
  are preferred to anything else; toads are occasionally eaten, but mice are never taken.</p>

  <p>The Grass-Snake can climb trees or rather shrubs and is an accomplished swimmer, often spending
  much of its time in water for fishing purposes. The fish is caught by the belly and then generally
  swallowed on land. The Grass-Snakes appear in the spring and disappear in the autumn to hibernate
  in the ground. They pair, in England, in the month of May or June, usually on warm and sunny
  mornings. The eggs are laid from July to the end of August, mostly in rich vegetable soil, in
  heaps of weeds or in manure-heaps. Young snakes lay fewer eggs than old specimens, which sometimes
  produce more than three dozen at a time. The eggs are soft, whitish yellow, about one inch long,
  and soon stick together, so that the whole clump <span class="pagenum" id="page609"><span
  class="smaller">{609}</span></span>can be taken up at once. As a rule the new-laid eggs do not
  contain any visible sign of the embryo, but it often happens that the snake has to delay
  oviposition, and then the embryos are more or less advanced. This is especially the case with
  recently caught specimens. The young are hatched in the late summer or in the autumn, and seem to
  live at first upon soft insects and worms. Curiously enough they are easily drowned when they fall
  into the water, even in a shallow tank. My tame snakes have often laid eggs between the stones in
  the greenhouse; the young throve well upon unknown food, but most of them met their fate in the
  water. When they are a few weeks old they are strong enough to take baby-frogs.</p>

  <p>The Grass-Snake becomes very tame, learns to distinguish between different people, allows
  itself to be handled without hissing or without voiding the obnoxiously smelling contents of its
  cloaca and anal glands, will in time take the offered food from the hand, and will even crawl up
  the arm or sleeve and coil itself up contentedly. One of the finest specimens, quite green,
  without a trace of a collar, and with brownish-red eyes, I caught in the Guadiana, where it had
  been fishing in midstream. It swam towards the bank, dived, and hid itself at the bottom between
  rocks. This snake, a female, became very tame. It never hibernated, shed its skin regularly every
  few months, and grew within nine years from 35 inches to 42 inches in length.</p>

  <p>The Grass-Snake is perfectly harmless: although hissing, and striking out furiously with its
  head, it never bites, not even when it is severely handled. Its only defence consists of the awful
  contents of the cloaca and the anal glands, the secretion of which smells of concentrated essence
  of garlic mixed with other indescribable odours. The wildest specimens I have ever met with
  inhabited a swamp with a little stream to the north of Oporto close to the coast. To my utter
  surprise some of them actually made for me, swimming along rapidly with the head erect, about 6
  inches above the water, and darting forwards with widely opened jaws, but they did not bite. These
  and other kinds of allied snakes require to drink much and often. Occasionally they drink milk
  when this is offered them, but that they suck the udders of cows or the breasts of women is an
  idle fable.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page610"><span class="smaller">{610}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>T. viperinus.</i>&ndash;The scales are strongly keeled and form twenty-one to twenty-three
  longitudinal rows. The third and fourth labials border the eye. The anal shield is divided. The
  eyes and nostrils are directed upwards instead of sidewards, in adaptation to the essentially
  aquatic habits of this species, which lives upon fishes and Amphibia. The general colour is grey
  to reddish brown, with a black zigzag band along the back and a lateral series of black,
  yellow-eyed spots. The belly is yellow or red, checkered with black.</p>

  <p>The Viperine Snake bears a general resemblance to the common viper. It inhabits France, Italy,
  Spain and Portugal, and Morocco. Very large specimens attain a length of nearly 3 feet, but the
  ordinary size of adults is 2 feet. This snake spends most of its time in the water, but it is
  often found on land, basking on the top of a low wall or on a low shrub. It is exceedingly common
  in Spain and Portugal, where it inhabits almost every ditch, any standing water or slow river. In
  the Alemtejo, when during the rainless and hot summer the small <span class="pagenum"
  id="page611"><span class="smaller">{611}</span></span>rivers have nearly dried up, these snakes
  collect in great quantities in the remaining stagnant and muddy pools, and as the stock of
  suitable fish gets exhausted, are often reduced to a deplorably emaciated condition. By the month
  of August they have become so thoroughly aquatic that they cannot be kept alive in dry
  surroundings for twenty-four hours. Those which I collected generally died, apparently from some
  kind of cutaneous suffocation, during the night following their capture. Taken under other
  conditions they are very easily kept and tamed.</p>

  <p>I once caught a Viperine Snake in a ditch whilst it was swallowing an eel of nearly its own
  length. Both were separated, and then put into a small bag together with other creatures, and no
  more attention was paid to them for several hours. When I opened the bag again, the snake,
  undisturbed by my incessant walking about, was again busily engaged in trying to get outside that
  same eel!</p>

  <p><i>T. sirtalis</i> (Fig. 160) is one of the almost endless varieties of what is now known by
  the name <i>T. ordinatus</i>, of North and Central America.</p>

  <p><i>T. tesselatus</i> is closely allied to <i>T. viperinus</i>, which it represents in South
  Germany, Italy, South-Eastern Europe, and Asia; but the scales form only nineteen rows, and the
  fourth, or fourth and fifth labials, border the eye. The usual colour is olive-grey with dark
  little spots, and with a dark chevron-shaped band behind the occiput. The lower parts are yellow
  or red checkered with black, hence the specific name.</p>

  <p><i>Zamenis.</i>&ndash;The maxillary teeth are not closely packed; they increase slightly in
  size backwards, and the last two are often a little larger and separated from the rest by a
  diastema. The mandibular teeth rather decrease in size from before backwards, inversely with the
  upper teeth. The scales are smooth with apical pits; the sub-caudals form two rows. The eye is
  large, and has a round pupil. The range of this genus, with about thirty species, extends over the
  whole of the Periarctic region.</p>

  <p><i>Z.</i> (<i>Ptyas</i>) <i>mucosus</i> (Fig. 161), the Rat Snake of India, extending from
  Transcaspia to Java, is a very common species, often seen in menageries. Its general colour is
  brown above, often with black cross-bands on the hinder part of the body and tail. The under parts
  are yellowish. The fourth and fifth labials border the eye. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page612"><span class="smaller">{612}</span></span>The scales on the body form only seventeen
  rows. Another feature of this species is the prominent ridge of the back-bone, not only in
  half-starved but in well-conditioned specimens. The Rat Snake grows to a length of more than 7
  feet, and is as ill-tempered as most species of this genus.</p>

  <p><i>Z. gemonensis</i> s. <i>viridiflavus</i> inhabits France, Italy, the Balkan Peninsula, and
  Asia Minor. Its coloration is very variable. In general it is either green above and yellow below,
  hence the appropriate name <i>viridiflavus</i>, or the ground-colour of the back is greyish or
  olive-yellow with brownish spots, which form more or less longitudinal rows on the trunk, but
  gradually pass into blackish continuous lines on the tail; the under parts are yellow or greenish
  white, often with many very small, dark specks. The scales form seventeen or nineteen rows; the
  anal shield is divided. There are two small postocular scales and one subocular; of the eight
  labials, the fourth and fifth border the eye. This species is very lively, attacks <span
  class="pagenum" id="page613"><span class="smaller">{613}</span></span>and bites furiously, climbs
  well, and when suspended from branches can protrude half of its length in a horizontal direction.
  It eats any kind of Reptile, Bird, or Mammal it can master; small animals are swallowed directly,
  rats and moles are first killed by constrictions. Large specimens reach perhaps 6 feet in
  length.</p>

  <p><i>Z. hippocrepis</i> is the representative species in the Iberian Peninsula and in
  North-Western Africa. It is rarely more than 4 feet long, and is very pretty, the ground-colour
  being reddish or olive-yellow with a row of large, dark brown, yellow-edged spots along the back.
  Two rows of smaller spots adorn the sides; where the dark spots are large, the pale ground-colour
  is restricted to forming rings around the spots, producing a pretty appearance. The under parts
  are yellow or orange, with black spots. On the head is a dark, pale-edged patch in the shape of a
  horse-shoe, a feature alluded to by the specific name. Structural characters are the possession of
  a row of little subocular scales, which completely separate the eye from the labials, the double
  anal shield, and the small and smooth scales on the body, which form generally as many as
  twenty-seven rows.</p>

  <p><i>Z. constrictor.</i>&ndash;The American Black Snake. The scales are smooth, and arranged in
  seventeen rows; the anal shield is divided. The general colour above is uniform bluish-black;
  below slaty, tinged with blue; the chin and throat are silvery white, sometimes with a black spot.
  Large specimens attain a total length of 6 feet.</p>

  <p>Holbrook gives the following exhaustive account of this species, about which many sensational
  stories are current even in would-be scientific periodicals:&ndash;</p>

  <p>The "Black Snake" is one of the commonest of North American species. It is extremely active,
  climbing with facility, and running with great rapidity, whence it is not uncommonly called the
  "Racer." It frequents shady places, covered with thick shrubs, on the margins of water. It feeds
  on mice, toads, or small birds; and, as it is an excellent climber, is frequently seen on trees in
  search of birds' nests. It is a bold and daring serpent, enters barns and out-houses without fear,
  and has been known to destroy young chickens. Its specific name <i>constrictor</i> would imply
  that it suffocates or crushes its prey, but this according to Holbrook is at least doubtful. In
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page614"><span class="smaller">{614}</span></span>breeding season it
  is extremely irascible, and will frequently attack persons passing at a distance of several steps;
  the tail then quivers with rage, making a quick vibrating motion, which in forests and among dead
  leaves sounds not unlike the Rattle-Snake; it now elevates the head one or two feet from the
  ground, and darts upon its adversary; luckily its bite is harmless, and not more painful than the
  scratch of a pin.</p>

  <p>"It will even descend from trees to attack its enemy if teazed, yet it does not twine itself
  around the legs, as is commonly supposed.</p>

  <p>"The same power of charming its prey has been attributed to the Black as to the Rattle-Snake,
  and with still less appearance of reason; for this is a nimble animal, and can pursue its prey,
  while the Rattle-Snake must lie in wait for his. It is remarkable that the birds most commonly
  found 'charmed' are the Cat-bird (<i>Turdus carolinensis</i>) or red-winged Black-bird (<i>Icterus
  phoeniceus</i>). These birds choose thick and shady places on the margins of streams for their
  residence, and generally build their nests on such shrubs as the alder; the latter bird not
  unfrequently takes the precaution to select such bushes as are on small islands, or such as have
  their roots surrounded by water, and thus their home is more secure. Now the Black Snake chooses
  precisely the same localities, knowing probably the haunts of its prey. The serpent begins the war
  by besieging the nest; the old bird, aware of its intention, attacks it with fluttering and
  uncertain motions, accompanied by a plaintive cry of distress, and is then said to be 'charmed.'
  The snake is at last either driven off, or it captures the young and not unfrequently the old bird
  too.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes the old bird, by her cries, calls in the assistance of her neighbours to drive away
  the aggressor. I have seen more than a dozen birds thus engaged with a large Black Snake that had
  probably just committed some depredation, but was now quietly stretched on a rock, basking in the
  sun; and it was not a little singular that birds of very different genera, and those seldom seen
  together, all united in this warfare against a common enemy, and finally compelled him to seek
  shelter among some low, thick shrubs, by the violence of their assault."</p>

  <p><i>Zaocys</i>, with about half-a-dozen species in South-Eastern Asia, is closely allied to
  <i>Zamenis</i>. <i>Z. carinatus</i>, of the Malay <span class="pagenum" id="page615"><span
  class="smaller">{615}</span></span>Islands, grows to 10 feet in length; it is consequently one of
  the largest harmless Colubrine snakes. The scales form only sixteen to eighteen rows. The
  sub-caudals are double. The general colour above is dark olive, passing into greenish brown
  farther back. The under parts are yellowish; black and yellow posteriorly. The fifth and sixth
  labials border the eye.</p>

  <p><i>Coluber.</i>&ndash;The maxillary teeth are of equal size, but the anterior mandibular teeth
  are the longest. The head is distinct from the neck. The nasals are distinct; not fused with the
  loreals. The eye is rather large, with a round pupil. The scales, smooth or keeled, have apical
  pits; the ventrals are rounded or angulate laterally; the sub-caudals are double. They all lay
  eggs and constrict their food. Nearly fifty species in the Periarctic region.</p>

  <p><i>C.</i> (<i>Elaphis</i>) <i>quatuorlineatus</i> s. <i>quaterradiatus</i> inhabits Italy and
  South-Eastern Europe. It occurs also in the Southern Tyrol. The scales of this large snake, which
  grows to nearly 6 feet in length, are arranged in twenty-five rows, and are feebly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page616"><span class="smaller">{616}</span></span>keeled. The anal is divided.
  Adult specimens have a yellowish-brown ground-colour with a pair of black streaks on each side of
  the back. A black line extends from the eye to the angle of the mouth; the under parts are yellow,
  mostly closely spotted with brown. This snake is good-tempered, and keeps well in captivity. They
  live on sparrows, mice, lizards, etc., and are very fond of eggs. Large specimens can swallow
  several fowls' eggs in succession; the crushed remains of the shells are later disgorged. This
  handsome snake climbs extremely well in search of birds and their eggs, and it is not afraid of
  the water. The prey is caught either with the teeth or by a rapid twist of the tail; in any case,
  the prey is always strangulated by the constriction of coils thrown round it. A sparrow thus
  secured is literally passed through the moving coils along the snake's body into a position
  convenient for swallowing. Hungry snakes catch and secure several birds or mice before eating
  them. My own specimens became almost affectionately tame, never attempted to bite, and took food
  from the hand.</p>

  <p><i>C. leopardinus</i> is smaller, but is one of the handsomest snakes of Southern Italy,
  South-Eastern Europe, and Asia Minor. It is closely allied to the previously described species.
  The ground-colour is pale brown with a dorsal series of dark brown or reddish, black-edged,
  transverse spots, and a lateral alternating series of smaller black spots, or with two dark brown,
  black-edged stripes bordering a yellowish vertebral stripe; usually with a forked black mark on
  the occiput and nape. The under parts are white, checkered with black, sometimes with the latter
  colour prevailing.</p>

  <p><i>C. flavescens</i> s. <i>aesculapii</i> is the Aesculap-Snake, for which the almost unknown
  name of <i>longissimus</i> has now been unearthed in deference to the fetish of priority. This
  snake is of an extremely graceful and slender build, with a very long tail. Its home is the South
  of France, Italy, and South-Eastern Europe. It occurs sporadically in the Tyrol, for instance near
  Bozen, in Austria, at Baden near Vienna, in Germany only in the Taunus, especially at
  Schlangenbad, which has received its name from the frequent occurrence of this snake. This
  sporadic distribution favours the idea that these snakes were introduced by the Romans as inmates
  of the temples erected to Aesculapius at such watering-places. Specific characters are the smooth
  and shiny scales, <span class="pagenum" id="page617"><span
  class="smaller">{617}</span></span>which are arranged in twenty-one to twenty-three rows, the
  distinctly angulate ventrals and the double anal and sub-caudals; the fourth and fifth of the
  upper labials border the eye, which has a round pupil. The coloration is very variable, as a rule
  olive-brown above with a dark streak behind the eye; the upper lips and a triangular patch on the
  temples are yellow; the under parts are uniform pale yellow. Some specimens are pale golden brown;
  others are very dark, almost black; while some have four darker stripes along the body, and lastly
  whitish specks occur on the upper surface. Large Aesculap snakes grow to a length of 5 feet. Their
  food consists chiefly of mice. They become very tame, although many of them at first bite
  furiously. Their climbing capacities are astonishing, the snakes being able to scale high and
  vertical walls provided there is the slightest "foothold." Some of my specimens escaped in the
  room and were at last found near the ceiling, resting on the rods of the curtains, up the folds of
  which they had managed to wriggle. Boulenger kept one for many years in a glass cage, where the
  snake entwined himself round the branches of a stick and allowed us to take him with the stick out
  of its socket and to inspect him. Being kept in an inhabited room, the snake did not exactly
  hibernate, creeping into the moss at the bottom of the cage; but it refused to feed, and remained
  in a rather drowsy condition coiled up on its favourite stand. During the pairing season they
  frequently resort to the water, at Schlangenbad at least; the few eggs are deposited under dry
  moss or in dry, decayed wood, and are hatched in about six weeks.</p>

  <p><i>C.</i> (<i>Rhinechis</i>) <i>scalaris</i> has the smooth scales disposed in twenty-seven
  rows. The snout is strongly projecting, and has a <span class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped dark mark
  on the top; a black streak runs through the eye, and another black spot lies below the eye. Young
  specimens are pale brown with a series of dark <span class="sans fwb">H</span>-shaped marks on the
  back, suggesting a ladder, hence the specific name. In the adult these marks are replaced by a
  pair of brown stripes running along the back; the under parts are always uniform yellow. Total
  length about 3 feet. This snake is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and to the South of France.
  Most specimens are very ill-tempered. The young live upon locusts and small lizards, the old eat
  mice and small birds. In captivity they also take dead animals&ndash;a rare habit with snakes.</p>

  <p><i>Dendrophis</i> with about ten species inhabits South-Eastern Asia and Australia. They are
  typical Tree-Snakes. The scales are keeled, and form only thirteen or fifteen rows; those of the
  vertebral row are enlarged; the ventrals have a pair of suture-like lateral keels and a notch on
  each side, arrangements which are of great assistance in climbing, these snakes being able to
  slide up the branches of trees in almost straight lines instead of having to twist and undulate
  their way up.</p>

  <p><i>D. punctulatus</i>, of Northern and Eastern Australia, is olive-brown above, uniform or with
  black edges and yellow outer borders to the scales. The upper lips, the throat and anterior
  ventrals, are yellowish. Total length up to 6 feet.</p>

  <p><i>Leptophis</i> is a Neotropical genus of Tree-Snakes. The body and the extremely long,
  whip-like tail are very slender. The head is very distinct from the neck; the eye is large, with a
  round pupil. The scales form thirteen or fifteen rows; the ventrals are sometimes angulate
  laterally; the sub-caudals are double. <i>L.</i> (<i>Ahaetulla</i>) <i>liocerus</i> is a beautiful
  snake, green above <span class="pagenum" id="page619"><span
  class="smaller">{619}</span></span>with a golden lustre, while the under parts are yellow or
  white. The total length of this species amounts to 6 feet, the tail then being nearly 2 feet long.
  These graceful Tree-Snakes live upon small reptiles and birds and their eggs. When shaken out of a
  tree or frightened off they let themselves fall down from considerable heights, coiling body and
  tail like a watch-spring, and alighting on the ground upon the spiral, which breaks the fall.</p>

  <p><i>Coronella.</i>&ndash;The teeth are nearly all of equal size and form continuous series. The
  scales are smooth and have apical pits; the sub-caudals are double. The head is scarcely distinct

  <p><i>C. austriaca</i> s. <i>laevis</i>, the Smooth Snake. The scales are arranged in nineteen
  rows. Mostly the third and fourth labials border the eye. The anal shield is divided. The general
  colour is brown or reddish above, often with one or two lighter stripes, with small dark brown or
  red spots; two dark brown or red stripes on the nape, usually confluent with a large dark patch on
  the occiput; a dark streak extends from the nostril through the eye to the angle of the mouth. The
  under parts are red, orange, brown, grey or blackish, either uniform or speckled with black and
  white. The coloration is, however, subject to much variation, and some specimens strikingly
  resemble some of the Common Viper, which is also very variable in its coloration. The resemblance
  is enhanced when the Smooth Snake broadens its head by widening the jaws, as it is in the habit of
  doing. Two such similarly coloured specimens are represented in Fig. 165. On closer inspection the
  differences are great enough, the harmless snake having smooth scales, and the top of the head
  being covered with large shields; while the Viper has keeled scales, the top of the head being
  covered mostly with scales, a vertical (not round) pupil, and, moreover, when attacked, usually
  coils itself into a spiral disc with the head standing out in the middle, ready to strike.
  However, these two species are sometimes mistaken for each other.&ndash;The Smooth Snake prefers
  lizards as food to anything else, but it also takes mice. The prey is hunted chiefly in the late
  afternoon and in the evening, and is constricted by the coils of the snake. When caught or even
  when handled after months of captivity, the Smooth Snake bites deliberately and firmly, selecting
  a suitable spot, for instance a finger, opens the mouth widely and almost chews the spot. The bite
  is of course quite harmless, and scarcely draws blood, few of these snakes attaining a length of
  more than 2 feet. They are viviparous, bringing forth about half-a-dozen young at a time. The
  range of the Smooth Snake extends over the greater part of temperate Europe, from England and the
  Iberian Peninsula to Berlin, and south-eastwards to Asia Minor. In England it occurs in a few
  counties only, for instance in Hampshire and in Dorsetshire.</p>

  <p><i>C. girondica</i>, of the South of France, Italy, the Iberian Peninsula and North-Western
  Africa, much resembles the English Smooth Snake, from which it differs in a few points only. The
  scales are arranged in twenty-one, rarely in nineteen, rows; usually the fourth and fifth labials
  border the eye; and the rostral <span class="pagenum" id="page622"><span
  class="smaller">{622}</span></span>shield, covering the end of the snout, is much broader than
  high. The coloration is variable, but there is always a pair of elongated blackish spots or a
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped mark on the nape.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Rhachiodontinae.</b>&ndash;With only a few teeth on the posterior part of the
  maxillaries, on the palatines and dentaries. Some of the vertebrae in the region of the lower neck
  have strongly developed hypapophyses, which are directed forwards and pierce the oesophagus. They
  are used for filing through or breaking the birds' eggs which seem to be the chief food of these
  snakes.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Dasypeltis scabra</i>, the only species, inhabits Tropical and South Africa;
  although it reaches scarcely more than two feet and a half in length, such a specimen is able to
  swallow an ordinary fowl's egg. Pigeons' eggs are swallowed by snakes little more than one foot in
  length, which seems at first sight quite impossible. The swallowed egg distends the skin to its
  utmost capacity; it then slides down further, the snake makes some slight contortions and the
  swelling collapses; after a while the broken and sucked-out shell is vomited out as a crumpled up
  <span class="pagenum" id="page623"><span class="smaller">{623}</span></span>mass. Miss Durham has
  illustrated this curious process in a series of drawings.<a id="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series B. OPISTHOGLYPHA.</b></p>

  <p>One, or a few, of the posterior maxillary teeth have a groove or furrow in front, which
  conducts the secretion of the enlarged upper labial glands. Apparently all these snakes are more
  or less poisonous, paralysing their prey before or during the act of deglutition. So far as man is
  concerned they are rather harmless, since the poison is not very strong, not available in large
  quantities, and above all because the small poison-teeth stand so far back that the snakes cannot
  easily inflict wounds with them.</p>

  <p>The Opisthoglypha are of considerable morphological interest, since they connect the Colubridae
  with the Viperidae, the characteristic poisonous apparatus of which seems to have been derived
  from that of the Opisthoglypha by the reduction or shortening of the anterior portion of the
  maxillaries and the harmless teeth, so that the posterior or poison-fangs come to the front.</p>

  <p>The Opisthoglypha comprise about three hundred species and are cosmopolitan, including
  Madagascar but excepting New Zealand. They contain truly terrestrial, arboreal, and thoroughly
  aquatic forms.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Dipsadomorphinae.</b>&ndash;The nostrils are lateral and the dentition is well
  developed. Long-tailed, terrestrial, and arboreal forms. Most of the arboreal species are green
  above, often with white or yellow longitudinal bands, while the under parts are white or yellow.
  They feed chiefly upon lizards, birds and their eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Dipsadomorphus</i> s. <i>Dipsas</i> (part).&ndash;Typical, very long-bodied and long-tailed
  Tree-Snakes, with a vertical pupil. The median or vertebral row of smooth scales is enlarged; the
  broad ventral scales are bent at an obtuse angle on the sides, the resulting ridge assisting in
  climbing. The sub-caudals are arranged in two rows. Ten to fourteen maxillary teeth are followed
  by two or three enlarged, grooved fangs.</p>

  <p><i>D. trigonatus</i>, of India, grows to one yard in length. Yellowish olive or pale grey
  above, with a white, black-edged <span class="pagenum" id="page624"><span
  class="smaller">{624}</span></span>zigzag band along the back, or with a series of white,
  black-edged spots.</p>

  <p><i>D. cyaneus</i>, of Northern India, Assam, etc., is a beautiful Tree-Snake, green above, with
  the skin between the scales black, uniform greenish yellow below. Total length up to 4 or 5
  feet.</p>

  <p><i>Dipsas</i> e.g. <i>D. bucephala</i>.&ndash;Maxillaries with eleven or more teeth. Pterygoids
  toothless. Body strongly compressed, with thirteen rows of smooth scales; the vertebral row
  enlarged; sub-caudals double; tail very long. Tropical South America.</p>

  <p><i>Leptognathus</i> with many species in Central and South America, like <i>Dipsas</i>, but
  with teeth on the pterygoids.</p>

  <p><i>Coelopeltis.</i>&ndash;Terrestrial and diurnal, with a round pupil. The row of small
  maxillary teeth is followed by one or two much larger, grooved fangs situated at a level below the
  posterior border of the eye. The first half-a-dozen mandibular teeth are much larger than the
  rest. The scales of the adult are more or less distinctly grooved longitudinally, hence the
  generic name, and are arranged in seventeen or nineteen rows. The sub-caudals form two rows; the
  ventrals are rounded off laterally. Two species in the Mediterranean countries and in
  South-Western Asia.</p>

  <p><i>C. monspessulana</i> s. <i>lacertina</i> is one of the largest snakes in Europe, reaching a
  length of 6 feet, of which the tail takes up 18 inches. Olive-brown or yellowish or reddish above,
  frequently with small, dark, light-edged spots. The sides are often blackish, with whitish specks.
  The under parts are yellowish white, with or without brownish markings. Some specimens are very
  green, with a dull blackish neck. One of the specific names of this terrestrial snake is the
  latinised form of Montpellier; the other refers to the shape of the head, which is not unlike that
  of a lizard, partly owing to the concave forehead. This species inhabits rather dry localities
  studded with shrubs, where it hunts for lizards, birds, and mice. It is sure to attract notice by
  its loud hissing when it is disturbed. When driven into a corner it strikes out furiously, but
  does not, as a rule, bite. I have caught some which after a few days became quite gentle. Small
  animals become torpid a few minutes after they have been bitten.</p>

  <p><i>Macroprotodon cucullatus</i> occurs in Andalucia, the Balearic Islands, and in North Africa.
  The dentition is peculiar. The <span class="pagenum" id="page625"><span
  class="smaller">{625}</span></span>fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are enlarged, followed by an
  interspace, then follow several small teeth, and lastly the two enlarged, grooved teeth. The sixth
  mandibular tooth is very long, separated by a space from the much smaller posterior teeth. The
  general colour of this sand-loving snake is pale brown or grey above with small spots or streaks
  on the trunk, and with a large black patch behind the head extending over the sides of the neck,
  hence the specific name. The under parts are bright red or yellowish, sometimes spotted with
  black. Total length under 2 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Elachistodontinae.</b>&ndash;With only a few teeth on the posterior part of the
  maxillary and dentary bones, and on the palatines and pterygoids. Some of the vertebrae in the
  thoracic region have much-developed unpaired hypapophyses, which are directed forwards and pierce
  the dorsal wall of the gullet. In this respect <i>Elachistodon westermanni</i>, of Bengal, the
  only species, bears a striking resemblance to the South African Aglyphodont <i>Dasypeltis</i> (see
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page622">622</a></span>), and it is probable that this apparently
  very rare Indian snake also swallows eggs. It is brown above, with a yellowish vertebral stripe;
  yellowish below.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Homalopsinae.</b>&ndash;The nostrils of these absolutely aquatic and viviparous
  snakes are valvular, and are situated on the upper surface of the snout. The eyes are small with
  vertical pupils. The two dozen species, mostly very ugly, inhabit the rivers and estuaries of the
  East Indies from Bengal to North Australia. Some species have very small and narrow ventral
  scales, recalling the Hydrophinae, or the burrowing snakes, none of which use their ventral scales
  for locomotory purposes.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Homalopsis buccata</i>, <i>Cerberus rhynchops</i> and <i>Hypsirhina</i>, e.g.
  <i>H. plumbea</i>, have well-developed ventral scales; the other scales of the first two genera
  are keeled, those of the third are smooth. In <i>Hipistes</i> the whole head is covered with very
  small scales; all the scales of the body are smooth except the very narrow ventrals, which have
  double keels. <i>H. hydrinus</i>, of Siam and the Malay Peninsula, has a compressed body, and in
  its general appearance much resembles the Hydrophinae. It lives, like its allies, upon fishes, and
  it swims far out into the sea.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Series C. PROTEROGLYPHA.</b></p>

  <p>The anterior maxillary teeth are deeply grooved, or so folded <span class="pagenum"
  id="page626"><span class="smaller">{626}</span></span>as to appear hollow or perforated. Behind
  these enlarged poison-fangs the maxilla carries a series of smaller, solid teeth; hence the term
  "proteroglyphous," which means that the anterior teeth are grooved, in opposition to
  "opisthoglyphous." Both series have been developed independently.</p>

  <p>The Proteroglypha are all extremely poisonous, mostly viviparous, and widely distributed over
  the whole of the Australian, Palaeotropical and Neotropical regions, with the exception of
  Madagascar and New Zealand; they extend northwards into the warmer parts of North America, and
  they also range over a great portion of the Palaearctic sub-region, being found in North Africa
  and South-Western Asia. They form two natural sub-families: Elapinae, with cylindrical tails, and
  Hydrophinae or Sea-Snakes, with laterally compressed tails.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Elapinae.</b>&ndash;The tail is cylindrical. The Elapinae comprise nearly 150
  species, which have been grouped into a great number of, mostly somewhat imaginary, genera. In
  Australia they constitute the great majority of Snakes, there being besides the deadly Elapinae
  only a few Pythons and Typhlopidae, and very few Colubrinae.</p>

  <p><i>Naja.</i>&ndash;The pair of large and grooved poison-fangs are separated by an interspace
  from one to three small, faintly grooved teeth near the posterior end of the maxillaries. The
  scales are smooth and without pits, and are arranged in fifteen to twenty-five oblique rows on the
  trunk, although more occur in the region of the neck; the vertebral row is not enlarged. The head
  is but slightly distinct from the neck. Each nostril lies between two nasals and the internasal.
  The sub-caudals form two rows. The pupil is round. The neck-region can be expanded <span

  and moving headwards of the ribs. Several species in Southern Asia and in Africa.</p>

      &#x2155;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>N. tripudians</i> (the "Cobra").&ndash;The coloration varies much. The typical form is
  yellowish to dark brown with a black and white spectacle-mark on the dorsal side of the hood, and
  with a large black and white spot on each side of the corresponding under surface. Other specimens
  are uniform pale brown to blackish grey, without any markings on the hood. The Cobra is widely
  distributed, from Transcaspia to China and to the Malay Islands; in the Himalayas it ascends to
  about 8000 feet above the level of the sea. Very large specimens are said to attain more than 6
  feet in length, but a cobra of 5 feet, inclusive of the tail of 9 inches, is considered large. The
  Cobra prefers places which afford it a convenient hole to retire into; for instance, deserted
  hills of termites, ruins, heaps of stones and stacks of wood, and it has the disagreeable habit,
  like the harmless Rat-snake, <i>Zamenis mucosus</i>, of making itself at home in inhabited houses,
  probably attracted by the rats. Its chief food consists of small Vertebrates;&ndash;frogs,
  lizards, rats, occasionally fishes and <span class="pagenum" id="page628"><span
  class="smaller">{628}</span></span>small birds. It drinks much, and hunts chiefly in the late
  afternoon and in the evening, although it possesses a round pupil. It avoids hot sunshine. Many
  observations show that the cobras live in pairs, otherwise they do not take much notice of each
  other or of other kinds of snakes. The female lays about a dozen soft-shelled eggs as large as
  those of pigeons.</p>

  <p>This cobra is used by Indian conjurers. The "dance" is the habit of these snakes of erecting
  themselves, when agitated, upon the hinder third or quarter of their length, whilst they spread
  out the hood and sway the head and neck to the right and left, always in an attitude ready for
  striking. They are docile and by nature not vicious. Most of the performing cobras have their
  teeth drawn, and they then know well that they cannot bite. They only strike at the hand, just as
  uninjured specimens soon avoid biting into the iron rod with which they are lifted up in
  menageries. The drawing of the teeth is an operation which has to be repeated, since reserve-teeth
  soon take the place of the lost pair.</p>

  <p>I cannot refrain from relating an abstract of a ridiculous episode which happened in the Munich
  Aquarium in the year 1882. One of six specimens of the African species <i>Naja haje</i> was
  missing. The police closed the establishment, which during the following eight days was turned
  inside out without any other effect than that two other, harmless, snakes were discovered. Twice
  the building was fumigated with sulphur, until the Cobra was at last found suffocated, fifteen
  days after the beginning of the search. This snake caused the owner of the Aquarium a loss of
  nearly &pound;1500. But the cruel joke was, that during the commotion the man who had collected and sold
  the six snakes declared upon oath that their teeth had been so well drawn and the germs of
  possible reserve-teeth had been so thoroughly destroyed that the snakes were rendered absolutely
  harmless. But he was not believed, in spite of a commission of professors and doctors appointed,
  who experimented upon the remaining five Cobras with sulphur and did not find any poison-fangs,
  "although the mouth was probed and poked into as far down as the larynx."</p>

  <p>Cobras have quite a number of enemies. Peafowl and Jungle-cocks are said to be partial to young
  snakes; pigs eat them greedily, and are to a certain extent immune against <span class="pagenum"
  id="page629"><span class="smaller">{629}</span></span>their bite. The same applies, according to
  the most recent observations, to the famous Mongoos. Sir E. Tennent, in his <i>Natural History of
  Ceylon</i>, quoted several times in the present book, makes the following remarks about the
  immunity of this little creature:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"I have found universally that the natives of Ceylon attach no credit to the European story of
  the Mongoos (<i>Herpestes griseus</i>) resorting to some plant, which no one has yet succeeded in
  identifying, as an antidote against the bite of the venomous serpents on which it preys. There is
  no doubt that, in its conflicts with the cobra and other poisonous snakes, which it attacks with
  as little hesitation as the harmless ones, it may be seen occasionally to retreat, and even to
  retire into the jungle, and, it is added, to eat some vegetable.... A number of plants, such as
  the <i>Ophioxylon serpentinum</i> and <i>Ophiorhiza mungos</i>, the <i>Aristolochia indica</i>,
  the <i>Mimosa octandria</i>, and others, have each been asserted to be the Ichneumon's
  specific.... If the Ichneumon were inspired by that courage which would result from the
  consciousness of security, it would be so indifferent to the bite of the serpent, that we might
  conclude that, both in its approaches and its assault, it would be utterly careless as to the
  precise mode of attack. Such, however, is far from being the case; and next to its audacity,
  nothing can be more surprising than the adroitness with which it escapes the spring of the snake
  under a due sense of danger, and the cunning with which it makes its arrangements to leap upon the
  back and fasten its teeth in the head of the cobra. It is this display of instinctive ingenuity
  that Lucan celebrates where he paints the Ichneumon diverting the attention of the Asp by the
  motion of his bushy tail, and then seizing it in the midst of its confusion. See <i>Pharsalia</i>,
  lib. iv. verses 729-734."</p>

  <p>There is a widespread belief in the efficacy of "Snake-stones," which are generally pieces of
  charred bone, well polished, occasionally pieces of chalk or some similar porous substance, which,
  if pressed upon the bleeding wound, are supposed to absorb the poison. Snake-charmers profess to
  prepare such "stones," and to preserve the composition as a secret. The manufacture is a lucrative
  trade. The Boers bought them, imported from India, at high prices. Mr. Selous saw one, or heard of
  one, that was kept as an heirloom. Snake-stones are <span class="pagenum" id="page630"><span
  class="smaller">{630}</span></span>also made, and used, in Mexico, of charred hartshorn; they are
  called "piedras ponsonas."</p>

  <p>The use of the Snake-stone, called "Pamboo-Kaloo," has probably been communicated to the
  Singhalese by the itinerant snake-charmers who resort to the island from the coast of
  Coromandel.</p>

  <p>Although Sir E. Tennent describes several instances of the successful application of
  snake-stones as well authenticated, he has never himself been an eye-witness. Although two cases
  have been fully described, they do not at all exclude the possibility, nay the probability, that
  the Tamils imposed upon the Europeans in order to sell the snake-stones.</p>

  <p>"No doubt the snake-stones, owing to their porous nature, adhered to the bleeding wound, became
  saturated with blood, and then fell off. Very likely, in case of a poisonous bite, some of the
  venom would be sucked up too, but we do not know if those snakes were still in the possession of
  their poison-fangs. Properly conducted experiments with snake-stones have proved as little
  efficacious as the application of dry cup.</p>

  <p>"Theoretically snake-stones as quick absorbent agents of the blood with the poison are good;
  they will certainly prevent some of the poison from entering the system, but that would, at best,
  be a partial cure only.</p>

  <p>"In March 1854 a friend of mine was riding, with some other civil officers of the Government,
  along a jungle path in the vicinity of Bintenne, when he saw one of two Tamils, who were
  approaching the party, suddenly dart into the forest and return, holding in both hands a Cobra de
  capello, which he had seized by the head and tail. He called to his companion for assistance to
  place it in their covered basket, but in doing this, he handled it so inexpertly that it seized
  him by the finger, and retained its hold for a few seconds, as if unable to retract its fangs. The
  blood flowed, and intense pain appeared to follow almost immediately; but with all expedition the
  friend of the sufferer undid his waist-cloth, and took from it two snake-stones, each of the size
  of a small almond, intensely black and highly polished, though of an extremely light substance.
  These he applied, one to each wound inflicted by the teeth of the serpent, to which they attached
  themselves closely; the blood that oozed from the bites being rapidly imbibed by the porous
  texture of <span class="pagenum" id="page631"><span class="smaller">{631}</span></span>the article
  applied. The stones adhered tenaciously for three or four minutes, the wounded man's companion in
  the meanwhile rubbing his arm downwards from the shoulders towards the fingers. At length the
  snake-stones dropped off of their own accord; the suffering of the man appeared to subside; he
  twisted his fingers till the joints cracked, and went on his way without concern. Whilst this had
  been going on, another Indian of the party, who had come up, took from his bag a small piece of
  white wood, which resembled a root, and passed it gently near the head of the cobra, which the
  latter immediately inclined close to the ground; he then lifted the snake without hesitation, and
  coiled it into a circle at the bottom of his basket. The root by which he professed to be enabled
  to perform this operation with safety he called the "Naya-thalic kalanga" (the root of the
  snake-plant), protected by which he professed his ability to approach any reptile with
  impunity."</p>

  <p>The following narrative, communicated to Sir E. Tennent by H. E. Reyne, of the Department of
  Public Works, Colombo, seems to exclude the possibility of deception:&ndash;</p>

  <p>"A snake-charmer came to my bungalow in 1854, requesting me to allow him to show me his snakes
  dancing. As I had frequently seen them, I told him I would give him a rupee if he would accompany
  me to the jungle and catch a cobra that I knew frequented the place. He was willing, and as I was
  anxious to test the truth of the charm, I counted his tame snakes, and put a watch over them until
  I returned with him. Before going I examined the man, and satisfied myself he had no snake about
  his person. When we arrived at the spot, he played on a small pipe, and after persevering for some
  time, out came a large cobra from an ant-hill, which I knew it occupied. On seeing the man it
  tried to escape, but he caught it by the tail and kept swinging it round until we reached the
  bungalow. He then made it dance, but before long it bit him above the knee. He immediately
  bandaged the leg above the bite, and applied a snake-stone to the wound to extract the poison. He
  was in great pain for a few minutes, but after that it gradually went away, the stone falling off
  just before he was relieved. When he recovered he held a cloth up, which the snake flew at, and
  caught its fangs in it; while in that position, the man passed his hand up its back, and having
  seized it by the throat, <span class="pagenum" id="page632"><span
  class="smaller">{632}</span></span>he extracted the fangs in my presence and gave them to me. He
  then squeezed out the poison on to a leaf. It was a clear oily substance, and when rubbed on the
  hand produced a fine lather. I carefully watched the whole operation, which was also witnessed by
  my clerk and two or three other persons."</p>

  <p><i>N. haje</i> is the common hooded cobra of Africa, the "Aspis," so called on account of its
  shield or hood&ndash;the "Spy-Slange" of the Boers. As a rule the spectacle-marks on the neck are
  absent or indistinct, the general colour varies much, either brown above, yellowish beneath, with
  or without brown spots; or dark brown above with yellowish spots, dark brown beneath; or blackish
  above and beneath. The name Spy-Slange, meaning Spitting Snake, refers to the habit which this and
  other African Cobras have of letting the poison drop from the mouth like saliva when they are
  excited. This is not a particularly economical habit, nor is it of the slightest use to the
  snake.</p>

  <p><i>N.</i> (<i>Ophiophagus</i> s. <i>Hamadryas</i>) <i>bungarus</i> s. <i>elaps</i> is the
  "Hamadryad" or "Snake-eating Cobra" or "King Cobra." It has a well dilatable hood; the very
  variable coloration is yellowish to black, with or without an olive gloss. Many specimens have
  more or less distinct dark cross-bands or rings around the body, while others are olive above with
  black-edged scales, and others again are very dark above and beneath. The distinctive, specific
  character is the small number of scales, these forming only fifteen rows on the middle of the
  body, nineteen or twenty-one on the dilatable neck. There is a pair of large occipital shields
  behind the parietals.</p>

  <p>This snake reaches the length, enormous for a poisonous snake, of 12 feet or more. Its size and
  very poisonous nature make it the curse of the jungle. It ranges from India to South China, and to
  the Philippines. The food seems to consist entirely of other snakes.</p>

  <p><i>Sepedon haemachates</i> is another hooded snake in South Africa, where it is known as the
  "Ringhals," <i>i.e.</i> banded neck. It differs from <i>Naja</i> by the absence of small teeth on
  the maxillaries behind the fangs, and by the strongly keeled scales, which form nineteen rows. The
  general colour is black above variegated with yellow or pale brown; the under parts are also
  black, often with one or two whitish bands across the lower portion of the neck.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page633"><span class="smaller">{633}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Rev. G. Fisk<a id="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> mentions the case of two
  young "Ringhals," of 10 and 9 inches in length, having been attacked and partly devoured by a
  mouse, supposed to be <i>Dendromys melanotis</i>, which was put with the snakes in a band-box.  On
  the habits of the Ringhals see Symonds.<a id="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Bungarus.</i>&ndash;The scales are smooth, and form thirteen to seventeen rows. The spine is
  very prominent, and the median row of scales which covers the ridge is much enlarged. There is no
  dilatable hood. In other respects <i>Bungarus</i> is closely allied to <i>Naja</i>; about
  half-a-dozen species, in South-Eastern Asia.</p>

  <p><i>B. fasciatus</i> reaches a length of 5 feet. The general colour is bright yellow,
  alternating with blackish rings.</p>

  <p><i>B. coeruleus</i> s. <i>candidus</i> is the dreaded "Krait," occurring in the whole of the
  Indian sub-region. It is dark brown or bluish black with narrow cross-bars or white specks, or it
  is alternately barred brown and yellow; the under parts are uniform white. Total length rarely 4
  feet.</p>

  <p>The "Krait" seems to cause more deaths in India than any other snake, since it is very common,
  especially in Bengal and in <span class="pagenum" id="page634"><span
  class="smaller">{634}</span></span>Southern India, and often creeps into the houses. It lives
  chiefly on rats, lizards, and snakes.</p>

  <p><i>Callophis.</i>&ndash;With only thirteen rows of smooth scales. The head is small, not
  distinct from the neck. The small eye has a round pupil. The short tail has two ventral rows of
  scales. The whole body is cylindrical. Several small species, one or two feet in length, in
  South-Eastern Asia. <i>C. macclellandi</i> in India and Indo-China is reddish brown above, yellow
  below, with regular, equidistant, black, light-edged cross-bands or rings. Total length up to 2
  feet.</p>

  <p><i>Doliophis</i> differs from <i>Callophis</i> mainly by the enormously developed poison-glands
  which, instead of being restricted to the head, extend along the anterior third of the body,
  gradually thickening, and terminating in front of the heart with club-shaped ends. Owing to the
  extension of these glands, which can be felt through the skin as thickenings at the end of the
  first third of the body, the heart has been shifted farther back than in any other snake. Several
  species in Indo-China and in the Malay Islands, <i>D. intestinalis</i> with many
  colour-variations.</p>

  <p>Australia suffers from an abundance of Elapine snakes, of which we will mention only the three
  commonest.</p>

  <p><i>Pseudechis</i> e.g. <i>Ps. porphyriaceus</i>, the "Black Snake" of Australia, has seventeen
  rows of smooth scales on the body, a few more on the neck, which however is not, or is only
  slightly, dilated. A few of the sub-caudal scales are undivided, the rest are paired. The head is
  distinct from the neck; the pupil is round. Total length up to 5 or 6 feet. The general colour
  above is black, with the outer row of scales red at the base; the ventral scales are red with
  black edges. The females are generally more brown than black, and are therefore sometimes known as
  "Brown Adders." They live on small mammals, birds, lizards and other snakes.</p>

  <p><i>Notechis scutatus</i> s. <i>Hoplocephalus curtus</i>, the "Tiger Snake," has rather small
  eyes with round pupils. The head is distinct from the cylindrical body, which is covered with
  fifteen to nineteen rows of smooth scales. The sub-caudals are single. The head of this variably
  coloured snake is mostly black, the body olive brown with dark cross-bands; towards the tail the
  coloration becomes more uniformly blackish. The under parts are pale <span class="pagenum"
  id="page635"><span class="smaller">{635}</span></span>yellow. The range of this very common snake
  extends over Tasmania and Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Acanthophis antarcticus</i>, the "Death Adder," is easily recognised by the peculiar tail,
  the end of which is laterally compressed, beset with a few rows of enlarged imbricating scales,
  and terminates in a thin horny spine. The head is distinct from the neck, and flat; the eye has a
  vertical pupil. The short and thick body is covered with twenty-one or twenty-three rows of keeled
  scales. The anterior caudals are single, the posterior double. The colours of the upper parts are
  a mixture of brown, reddish and yellow, with dark cross-bands. The belly is pale yellow, often
  spotted with brown or black. The end of the tail is yellow, reddish brown or black. The total
  length of this stout and ugly viviparous creature remains under 3 feet. It is widely distributed
  from South Australia to the Moluccas. The use of the peculiar tail very probably consists in
  attracting or fixing the attention of small animals; the snake, lying coiled up on a dry and sandy
  spot, slightly raising and vibrating the tip of the tail.</p>

  <p><i>Elaps</i> is an entirely American genus, with many species, most of which are extremely
  prettily coloured, red and black in alternate rings being a favourite pattern. The maxillaries
  carry no teeth behind the poison-fangs. The scales of the body are smooth and form fifteen rows.
  The tail is short. The small eye has mostly a vertical pupil. The head is very small, not distinct
  from the neck. The squamosal and quadrate bones are short, and the gape of the mouth is so limited
  that these beautiful snakes, although possessing strong poison, are practically harmless to man.
  One of the prettiest is <i>E. corallinus</i> of the forests of Tropical South America and the
  Lesser Antilles. The whole body, above and below, is adorned with about twenty deep black rings,
  which are edged with yellow and again separated by red rings equalling in width the black ones.
  Sometimes the red rings are dotted with black, and the black dots may form additional rings
  between the red and the yellow. Total length under 3 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Hydrophinae</b> (Sea-Snakes).&ndash;The tail is strongly compressed, sometimes
  the body also. All the scales are small, and there are often no enlarged ventrals. The eyes are
  small, with round pupils. All these snakes are very poisonous and live in the sea, often at
  considerable distances from the land, <span class="pagenum" id="page636"><span
  class="smaller">{636}</span></span>with the exception of one species of <i>Distira</i>, <i>D.
  semperi</i>, which is confined to the land-locked freshwater Lake Taal at Luzon in the
  Philippines. They live on fish, and range from the Persian Gulf to Central America. In conformity
  with their absolutely aquatic life they are viviparous, and they die when kept out of the water
  for any length of time. About fifty species are known.</p>

  <p><i>Enhydrina valakadien s. bengalensis</i> has scales with a small tubercle or keel, which is
  stronger in the males; the ventrals are very small, forming a scarcely enlarged series. The
  maxillaries carry two or more small grooved teeth in addition to the poison-fangs. The back is
  olive or dark grey, with black transverse bands, which are most distinct in the young. The under
  parts are white. This species ranges from Persia to the Malay Islands.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Hydrophis</i> e.g. <i>H. obscura</i>.&ndash;The body is long; the head and neck are very
  slender, the body becoming much thicker farther back. The small teeth behind the poison-fangs are
  not grooved. The ventral scales are very small, the others are keeled, strongly so <span
  class="pagenum" id="page637"><span class="smaller">{637}</span></span>in the males. The general
  coloration of this Sea-Snake, which reaches about one yard in length, is dark olive-green above
  with yellowish cross-bars, which form complete rings round the slender part of the body. Other
  specimens are pale olive, with dark cross-bands. This species occurs in the Bay of Bengal and the
  Malay Archipelago.</p>

  <p>As a rule Sea-Snakes are not found in mid-ocean. After leaving Ceylon, the steamer meets them
  again in the Straits of Malacca. Those which occur near the south coast of Japan, e.g. <i>Distira
  cyanocincta</i>, are found there only in the summer, and are probably carried there by the
  south-west monsoon.</p>

  <p>According to Semper the gravid female visits the shores of low islands, there to give birth to
  its young between the rocks, and she remains with her offspring for some time. Semper once found a
  large female, probably <i>Platurus fasciatus</i> s. <i>colubrinus</i>, coiled up amongst rocks,
  and between the folds were at least twenty young, each already about 2 feet long.</p>

  <p>Boulenger<a id="NtA_193" href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> has written an interesting popular
  account of Sea-Snakes.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Amblycephalidae.</b>&ndash;Some thirty species of Neotropical and Oriental Snakes
  have been separated from the Colubridae on account of the pterygoids, which are widely separated
  from the quadrates, the posterior ends of the pterygoids not reaching beyond the level of the
  occipital condyle. This condition can be ascertained when the mouth is opened widely. The
  prefrontals are not in contact with the nasals. The squamosals are reduced to pad-like vestiges.
  Externally the Amblycephalidae are easily distinguished from the Colubridae by the absence of a
  longitudinal median mental groove. The head is thick, very distinct from the neck, and gives these
  harmless snakes a "poisonous" appearance. The pupil is vertical.</p>

  <p><i>Amblycephalus</i>, e.g. <i>A. monticola</i>.&ndash;Maxillaries short, with only five or six
  teeth. Sub-caudals in two rows. Body compressed, covered with fifteen rows of scales.
  South-Eastern Asia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Viperidae.</b>&ndash;The maxillaries are very short, movably attached to the
  prefrontals and ectopterygoids, so that they can be erected together with the large poison-fangs,
  which (besides reserve-teeth) are the only maxillary teeth. The prefrontals are not in contact
  with the nasals. The squamosals are very loosely <span class="pagenum" id="page638"><span
  class="smaller">{638}</span></span>attached. For further details see Fig. 180. The poison-fangs
  are perforated, having a wide hole on the anterior side at the base, in connexion with the large
  poison-gland; the hole leads into a canal, which opens gradually as a semi-canal on the anterior
  surface of the distal third or quarter of the tooth. As usual in poisonous snakes, several
  reserve-teeth are stowed away behind the acting fang. When the latter is broken off or has served
  its time it is cast off at the base, and the next reserve tooth takes its place. The supply of
  reserve-teeth is indefinite, half-finished teeth down to mere germs constantly growing.</p>

  <p>All the Viperidae are very poisonous, and all, except the African <i>Atractaspis</i>, are
  viviparous. They include terrestrial, arboreal, semi-aquatic, and burrowing types. The family is
  cosmopolitan, excepting Madagascar and the whole of the Australian region; it is divided into
  Vipers and Pit-Vipers.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Viperinae</b> (Vipers).&ndash;There is no sensory external pit between the eye
  and the nose, and the maxillary is not hollowed out above. The Vipers are absolutely restricted to
  the Old World, ranging over the whole of Europe, Africa, and Asia, with the exception of
  Madagascar; their northern extension is limited only by the permanently frozen condition of the
  underground. Nine genera with about forty species are known.</p>

  <p><i>Causus</i> with a few species in Africa and <i>Azemiops feae</i> in Upper Burmah are the
  only vipers which have the head covered <span class="pagenum" id="page639"><span
  class="smaller">{639}</span></span>with large symmetrical shields, while in the other genera the
  head-shields are broken up into scales or small shields. <i>Causus rhombeatus</i> is very common
  in Africa, from the Gambia to the Cape. It reaches a length of a little more than 2 feet. Pale
  olive-brown above, usually with a dorsal series of large rhombic or V-shaped dark brown, sometimes
  white-edged spots, and with a dark arrow-shaped mark on the occiput; under parts yellowish white
  or grey.</p>

  <p><i>Bitis</i> s. <i>Echidna</i>.&ndash;Very much like <i>Vipera</i>, but the nasal shields are
  separated from the rostral by small scales, and the postfrontal bone is very large.  Several
  species in Africa.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The head is very distinct from the neck, chiefly owing to the large poison-glands and to its
  being, like the body, much depressed. The small eye has a vertical pupil, and is separated from
  the labials by a series of small scales. The scales are keeled, and form many, from twenty-nine to
  forty-one, rows; the tail is very short, with two rows of scales below.</p>

  <p>In <i>B. arietans</i>, the "Puff Adder," the nostrils are directed upwards. This ugly brute is
  yellowish to orange brown above with regular, chevron-shaped dark bars or other markings, helping
  <span class="pagenum" id="page640"><span class="smaller">{640}</span></span>to conceal the
  creature when it is lying on sandy and stony ground; the under parts are yellowish white. The Puff
  Adder reaches a length of 4, or very rarely 5 feet, ranging all over Africa, except the north
  coast, and extending into Southern Arabia. It is very slow, and trusts to not being discovered
  when lying in the dry grass; when approached it inflates the body and hisses loudly with a puffing
  sound, watches the enemy with raised and characteristically bent head and neck; but it bites only
  when actually touched or attacked. The effect of the bite is very dangerous. Its prey consists
  chiefly of small mammals, which are hunted during the night.</p>

  <p><i>B. (Echidna) nasicornis</i>, of Tropical West Africa, has two or three enlarged scales above
  the supranasals; they stand upon erectile tissue so as to form horn-like elevations. This
  "Nose-horned Viper" grows to a length of 4 feet, and is rather prettily marked; the ground-colour
  is purplish or reddish brown, with a vertebral series of large, pale, dark-edged spots and oblique
  crosses. The young are at birth as much as one foot in length, and are very tastefully
  coloured.</p>

  <p><i>Cerastes</i> and <i>Echis</i> prefer to burrow in sand. The lateral scales are smaller than
  the dorsals, and arranged obliquely with serrated keels, so that the snakes can cover themselves
  with sand by lateral shovelling motions of the sides of the body.</p>

  <p><i>Cerastes cornutus</i>, the "Horned Viper" of North-Eastern Africa, from Algeria to Arabia,
  extending also into Palestine, has the sides of the ventral scales bent angularly, with an obtuse
  keel on either side. Above each eye stands a large horny, spiky scale. The upper parts are pale
  yellowish brown, mostly with dark spots arranged in several longitudinal rows. The under parts are
  white. This, or perhaps <i>C. vipera</i>, which has no horns, is supposed to be the species which
  has become famous through the suicide of Cleopatra.</p>

  <p>About twenty years ago a number of "Horned Vipers" were brought to the Zoological Gardens of
  London, and attracted attention by their unusually long horns. It was found that some wily
  Egyptian snake-catcher had tried to manufacture a new species by taking specimens of the hornless
  <i>C. vipera</i> and inserting a pair of hedgehog's spines, pushing them upwards through the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>The "Horned Viper" attains a length of two feet and a half. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page641"><span class="smaller">{641}</span></span>In the daytime it is invisible, being buried
  in the sand with only the eyes, nostrils, and the "horns" appearing above the surface.</p>

  <p><i>Vipera.</i>&ndash;The head is distinct from the neck, and is covered with small scales and a
  few larger shields. The eye is separated from the labials by scales; the nasals are in contact
  with the rostral shield or separated by one naso-rostral shield. The scales on the body are
  strongly keeled; they are in two rows on the short tail. This genus with about ten species ranges
  over Europe, Asia, and the greater part of Africa.</p>

  <p><i>V. berus</i>, the Common European Viper (see Fig. 165, <span class="wnw">p. <a

  of the trunk form twenty-one rows. The coloration is very variable, there being grey, brown, red,
  or black specimens in the same country, and the much-spoken-of black zigzag line along the back is
  so often indistinct that it is a character not to be relied upon. Usually the grey, yellowish,
  olive, brown or red ground-colour is set off by a dark zigzag band along the spine, and by a
  series of lateral spots; an oblique or St. Andrew's cross or two diverging bold streaks of dark
  brown or black are usually present on the back of the head, and there is a dark streak behind the
  eye. The under parts are grey, brown, or black, uniform or speckled; the end of the tail is
  usually yellow or red.</p>

  <p>According to Boulenger, who is making a special study of the individual variations of Vipers
  (concerning colour, scaling, number of vertebrae, etc.), some specimens are entirely black in the
  males through extension of the black markings, in the females through darkening of the
  ground-colour. Males are usually distinguishable from females by darker, deep black markings and
  lighter ground-colour. The females are mostly larger than the males. The largest specimen in the
  British Museum measures 700 mm. = 28 inches, but a viper 2 feet long may be considered a very
  large specimen. The Common Viper has a wide range, from Wales to Saghalien Island, and from
  Caithness to the north of Spain. It ascends the Alps to a considerable altitude, up to 6000 feet.
  J. Blum<a id="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> has published an elaborate statistical
  account of the Viper in Germany, unfortunately confining himself strictly to the political
  frontiers. According to the map attached to his work, the Viper is common all over Germany with
  the exception of South-Western and parts of Middle Germany. It is absent in Alsace, the Bavarian
  Palatinate, Rhenish Prussia, Hesse, the northern half of Baden, W&uuml;rtemberg, and Franconia,
  countries which, speaking broadly, have a warm subsoil, composed of Red Sandstone and Basaltic
  formation. As a rule the Viper prefers heaths, moors, and mixed woods with sunny slopes. Brambles,
  clumps of nettles, hedges, the edges of little copses, heaps of stones, are favourite places of
  retreat, affording shelter, holes, and the vicinity of mice, which form its chief sustenance. At
  harvest-time it is often found in cornfields, and it frequently hides in the sheaves. Vipers are
  fond of basking on certain spots, on the top of a stone, the stump of a tree, or a patch of sand:
  a shower of rain or even passing clouds drive them back into their holes. They are eminently
  nocturnal, when they regularly "beat" their district, biting and paralysing their prey before
  swallowing it. A fire kindled at night is sure to draw vipers near; the same applies to other
  vipers, for instance <i>Cerastes</i>, which appears in perplexing <span class="pagenum"
  id="page643"><span class="smaller">{643}</span></span>numbers at the camp-fire. They cannot climb,
  and they avoid going into water. The pairing takes place as a rule from March to May, a number of
  individuals, mostly males, collecting around the females, and forming entangled lumps of snakes;
  parturition takes place in the following July and August. In exceptionally warm winters they have
  been known to pair in December, having left their winter-quarters. They hibernate for about six
  months, more or less according to the climate, congregating in great numbers, sometimes in dozens.
  With very rare exceptions Vipers do not take food in captivity, but prefer starving themselves to
  death. The bite is as a rule not fatal. The seriousness of the case depends of course upon many
  circumstances, as for instance the state of concentration of the venom, the position and depth of
  the bite, and last but not least upon the general condition of health of the victim. General
  depression aggravated by nervousness, weakness of the bitten limb, occasional breaking out of the
  wound, are of frequent and protracted occurrence. (See also <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page590">590</a></span>.)</p>

  <p><i>V. aspis</i> is a more southern and western European Viper, occurring from France to the
  Tyrol, and in Italy. The snout is slightly turned up at the end, and still more so in <i>V.
  latastei</i> of Spain and Portugal. In <i>V. ammodytes</i>, of South-Eastern Europe, the raised
  portion is produced into a soft, scaly appendage (see the lower figure on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page641">641</a></span>). Vipers are sometimes unpleasantly common in certain localities.
  This was for instance the case at the drill-ground near Metz, and the military authorities paid a
  price for each viper delivered to them. The supply of the latter increased to an alarming extent
  until the German authorities discovered that a regular trade had been established across the
  frontier, and that the French Lorrainers were importing vipers briskly.</p>

  <p><i>V. russelli</i>, the "Daboia" or Russell's Viper, is one of the scourges of India, Ceylon,
  Burma, and Siam. The scales form about thirty rows on the body. The upper surface of the head is
  covered with small, imbricating, usually keeled scales. The general colour is pale brown above
  with three longitudinal series of black, light-edged rings, which sometimes encircle reddish
  spots. The under parts are yellowish white, uniform, or with small crescentic black spots. Total
  length up to about 5 feet. The poisoning symptoms are described on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page590">590</a></span>.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 2. Crotalinae</b> ("Pit-Vipers").&ndash;With a deep cavity or pit between the eye
  and the nose, lodged in the hollowed-out maxillary bone. This pit is lined with a modified
  continuation of the epidermis, and is amply supplied with branches from the trigeminal nerve. It
  is undoubtedly sensory, but we do not know its function. A good anatomical account of this organ
  has been given by West.<a id="NtA_195" href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> Some of the Pit-Vipers
  have a rattle at the end of the tail; these are the Rattle-Snakes. The rattle is composed of a
  number of horny bells which fit into each other. The oldest or terminal bell is in reality the
  horny covering of the tip of the tail, and with each moult or shedding of the skin the youngest
  bell becomes loose, but is held by the new covering which has been developed in the meantime.
  There is thus produced an ever-increasing number of loosely-jointed bells, but now and then most
  or all the bells break off, probably when they are worn out, and a new set is gradually developed.
  Rattles with a dozen bells are, for instance, very rare. They naturally increase in bulk with the
  age of the snake, but the number of joints is no indication of the snake's age.</p>

  <p>Pit-Vipers have a very wide distribution. They are divided into four genera with about sixty
  species. Rattle-Snakes are <span class="pagenum" id="page645"><span

  large shields, but the internasals and prefrontals are sometimes broken up into scales. The scales
  of the body have apical, sensory pits. About ten species, some in Central and North America,
  others in the Caspian district (<i>A. halys</i>), in the Himalayas (<i>A. himalayanus</i>), in
  Ceylon, Java, etc.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>A. piscivorus</i> s. <i>Trigonocephalus cenchris</i> (part), the "Water-Viper," inhabits
  North America from Carolina and Indiana to Florida and Texas. The general colour is reddish to
  dark brown, with darker cross-bands or with <span class="sans fwb">C</span>-shaped markings; a
  dark, light-edged band extends from the eye to the angle of the mouth. The under parts are
  yellowish, spotted with black, or the latter is the prevailing colour. Total length up to 5 feet.
  The Water-Viper is semi-aquatic and lives chiefly on fishes, but it also eats other snakes and
  various Amphibia, Birds, and Mammals. This snake is very good-humoured in captivity, and becomes
  <span class="pagenum" id="page646"><span class="smaller">{646}</span></span>easily tame. A
  gentleman in Berlin, rather too much addicted to making pets of poisonous snakes, had a pair which
  propagated regularly. When I was a boy he invited me to feed the young Water-Vipers with fishes
  cut into strips, and I enjoyed this immensely until he warned me not to touch the mother, which
  might bite strangers.</p>

  <p><i>A. contortrix</i> s. <i>Trigonocephalus cenchris</i> (part), the "Moccasin-Snake" or
  "Copper-head," is one of the few poisonous snakes which possess a loreal shield, <i>i.e.</i> a
  shield intercalated between the pre-oculars and the nasals; below it lies the pit. The general
  colour is yellowish to pink or pale brown, with dark brown or red cross-bars or triangular marks.
  The under surface is yellowish or reddish, speckled with grey or brown, and with a lateral series
  of large blackish spots. Total length of full-grown specimens about one yard. The Moccasin-Snake
  ranges from Massachusetts and Kansas to Northern Florida and Texas. It prefers swampy localities
  or meadows with high grass, where it hunts for small Mammals and Birds.</p>

  <p><i>Lachesis.</i>&ndash;Without a rattle.  The upper surface of the head is covered with very
  small shields or with scales. About forty <span class="pagenum" id="page647"><span
  class="smaller">{647}</span></span>species in South-Eastern Asia and in Central and South
  America.</p>

  <p><i>L.</i> (<i>Bothrops</i> s. <i>Craspedocephalus</i>) <i>lanceolatus</i> inhabits nearly the
  whole of South America, extending into Mexico and the Lower Antilles, <i>e.g.</i> Martinique,
  Guadaloupe, and Santa Lucia, where it is known as the "Fer-de-Lance," and is the curse of the
  sugar-plantations on account of its being so very common and so deadly poisonous. The Mongoose was
  introduced as a possible antagonist, but the little Indian Mammal wisely left the dangerous
  reptile alone, and has in some places established himself as another pest&ndash;as a destroyer of
  poultry. The Fer-de-Lance grows to a length of 6 feet, establishes itself everywhere&ndash;in
  swamps, plantations, forests, in the plains and in the hills&ndash;and is very prolific,
  producing, according to its size, dozens of young which are 10 inches long, very active and
  snappy.</p>

  <p>The effect of the poison of Rattle-Snakes has been discussed on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page589">589</a></span>.</p>

  <p><i>C. horridus</i> is the common Rattle-Snake of the United States; <i>C. confluentus</i> is
  the species in Western and <i>C. durissus</i> the common species in South-Eastern North America.
  Very large Rattle-Snakes, <i>C. durissus</i>, attain a length of 8 feet, others not often more
  than five. They prey chiefly upon small Mammals, hunting for them at night. In the daytime they
  are also about, mainly in order to bask. Although they occasionally take to the water in pursuit
  of their prey, they dislike being wetted by rain, withdrawing then into their holes, appropriating
  as a rule those of ground-squirrels, rats, and Prairie-dogs. The often-repeated story about
  Rattle-Snakes living in neighbourly friendship in the holes of Prairie-dogs, together with the
  little Prairie-owls, is an exaggeration. We do not know how many of the original inmates are
  eaten. Pairing takes place in the spring. During the cold months they hibernate under ground,
  often in considerable numbers.</p>

  <p>Rattle-Snakes have few enemies besides man and pigs. The latter kill and eat them wherever they
  can. The rattle is decidedly useful to the snake as an instrument of warning off any approaching
  possible enemy, since no snake likes to bite unless in self-defence or in order to kill its prey.
  The noise of the rattle is very loud in dry weather, much duller on clammy days; it is a shrill
  sound like that of a rattling alarm-clock, and a well-conditioned snake in a room can make
  conversation well-nigh impossible, and can keep on rattling for half an hour or longer. The rattle
  is kept in such rapid lateral vibrations that it shows only a blurred image, the rattle standing
  with its broader sides vertically, not horizontally. They endure captivity for many years, and
  become tame enough not to hiss and to rattle whenever they are approached.</p>

  <p><i>C. horridus</i> is grey-brown above, usually with a rusty vertebral stripe and with <span
  class="sans fwb">V</span>- or <span class="sans fwb">M</span>-shaped blackish cross-bands; the
  under surface is yellowish; the end of the tail is blackish. The supra-ocular shields are smooth
  and much narrower than the scaly space between them, and there is only one pair of
  internasals.</p>

  <p><i>C. durissus</i> s. <i>adamanteus</i> differs from the previous species chiefly by possessing
  two pairs of internasals; and the dark <span class="pagenum" id="page650"><span
  class="smaller">{650}</span></span>markings on the body form a handsome pattern of rhombs with
  lighter centres and yellowish edges. This is the largest species of Rattle-Snake, reaching a
  length of 8 feet.</p>

  <p><i>C. confluentus</i> has broader, transversely striated, supra-ocular shields. The specific
  name refers to the continuous series of large brown or red rhomboidal spots on the back.</p>

    <p><i>CAMBRIDGE REVIEW.</i>&ndash;"Several of the groups treated of in this volume are unknown,
    by sight even, to the general reader, and possess no popular name whatsoever; and as only a few
    insignificant details are known of the habits of the animals composing them, their treatment in
    the volume before us has necessarily been to a large extent anatomical. This circumstance
    renders the book of especial value to students, more particularly as in some cases the articles
    on the groups in question are the first comprehensive ones dealing with their respective
    subjects.... Most of the articles are of a very high order of merit&ndash;taken as a whole, it
    may be said that they are by far the best which have as yet been published.... We may say with
    confidence that the same amount of information, within the same compass, is to be had in no
    other zoological work."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>NATURAL SCIENCE.</i>&ndash;"This second volume of the Cambridge Natural
    History is certain to prove a most welcome addition to English Zoological literature. It deals
    with a series of animal groups, all deeply interesting to the specialist in morphology; some
    important from their economic relations to other living things, others in their life-histories
    rivalling the marvels of fairy-tales. And the style in which they are here treated is also
    interesting; history and the early observations of the older writers lend their charm; accounts
    of habits and mode of occurrence, of life, in a word, from the cradle to the grave, are given in
    ample detail, accompanied by full references to modern and current literature. The whole is
    admirably illustrated."</p>

    appears, and I will venture to express the hope that this will be at no very distant period, we

    <p><i>SATURDAY REVIEW.</i>&ndash;"Dr. Sharp's treatment is altogether worthy of the series and
    of his own high scientific reputation. But in a work of this sort it is not only necessary that
    information should be accurate, but also that it shall be presented to the eye, so far as
    illustrations and printing are concerned, in such a way as to render its matter as easily
    intelligible as possible, and readily usable for purposes of reference. Under both these heads
    we have nothing but commendation for Mr. Sharp's treatise. The illustrations are indeed
    beautiful, and the use of the heavy type for the headings of the various sections and leading
    paragraphs materially helps the reader in the progress of his study. Certainly this is a book
    that should be in every entomologist's library."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>DAILY NEWS.</i>&ndash;"It would be hard to say too much in praise of this most
    admirable volume. It is too often the case that scientific books are written in a dull and
    uninteresting style. The reader will find nothing of that kind to complain of here. The
    descriptions are clear, the illustrations are excellent; while, as in the previous volumes of
    the series, printing and paper are all that could be desired."</p>

    <p><i>MORNING POST.</i>&ndash;"A delightful as well as a serviceable book.... Herein perhaps
    lies the great charm and merit of Dr. Gadow's book, that, while satisfying all the inquiries of
    the student, it is also in great part written for the ordinary intelligence, and the naturalist
    in the crowd may, while necessarily gliding over distressing technicalities, find in its pages
    many hours of profitable and entertaining study of the habits of the classes under notice."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>NATURE.</i>&ndash;"In concluding the review we would express the opinion that
    by this handsome volume a very important addition to science has been made; that the beautiful
    illustrations, together with the clear and charming accounts of the life-histories which it
    contains, will do much to popularise the study of a rather neglected section of zoology; and
    that lovers of Reptiles, of which there are more than one generally thinks, will feel that the

    recommend as a work of reference to all students of ornithology."</p>
    <p><i>NATURE NOTES.</i>&ndash;"We venture to predict that, of the ten volumes of which this
    excellent series is planned to consist, none will secure a wider popularity than Mr. Evans's
    treatise on birds. Strange as it may appear, among the many books on birds that have appeared of
    late years, we do not recall any that covers the same ground.... We are grateful to the author
    for the mine of valuable information which he has crowded between his two covers."</p>
    <p><i>SCIENCE GOSSIP.</i>&ndash;"General readers will find this work most useful in obtaining a
    proper understanding of birds, and will be assisted by the effective diagram of a hawk in the
    introduction, showing the recognised names of every part of the exterior appearance. The
    expressions used in naming the various portions are fully explained on the adjoining page. As we
    have already said, the illustrations are admirable. The book is a useful addition to any
    library, as it treats of nearly every known kind of bird throughout the world."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>SATURDAY REVIEW.</i>&ndash;"The expert and the novice alike must be at once
    delighted by the accuracy and the beauty of the illustrations.... It is astonishing to note the
